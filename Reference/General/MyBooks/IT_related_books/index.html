<p><em>Summary:</em> This is the digital version of the printed book (Copyright © 2008). Adrenaline junkies, dead fish, project sluts, true believers, Lewis and Clark, template zombies . . . Most developers, testers, and managers on IT projects are pretty good at recognizing patterns of behavior and gut-level hunches, as in, “I sense that this project is headed for disaster.” But it has always been more difficult to transform these patterns and hunches into a usable form, something a team can debate, refine, and use. Until now. In Adrenaline Junkies and Template Zombies, the six principal consultants of The Atlantic Systems Guild present the patterns of behavior they most often observe at the dozens of IT firms they transform each year, around the world. The result is a quick-read guide to identifying nearly ninety typical scenarios, drawing on a combined one-hundred-and-fifty years of project management experience. Project by project, you’ll improve the accuracy of your hunches and your ability to act on them. The patterns are presented in an easy-reference format, with names designed to ease communication with your teammates. In just a few words, you can describe what’s happening on your project. Citing the patterns of behavior can help you quickly move those above and below you to the next step on your project. You’ll find classic patterns such as these: News Improvement Management by Mood Ring Piling On Rattle Yer Dags Natural Authority Food++ Fridge Door and more than eighty more! Not every pattern will be evident in your organization, and not every pattern is necessarily good or bad. However, you’ll find many patterns that will apply to your current and future assignments, even in the most ambiguous circumstances. When you assess your situation and follow your next hunch, you'll have the collective wisdom of six world-class consultants at your side.</p>

<p><em>Summary:</em> Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit Adapting agile practices to your development organization Uncovering and eradicating waste throughout the software development lifecycle Practical techniques for every development manager, project manager, and technical leader Lean software development: applying agile principles to your organization In Lean Software Development, Mary and Tom Poppendieck identify seven fundamental "lean" principles, adapt them for the world of software development, and show how they can serve as the foundation for agile development approaches that work. Along the way, they introduce 22 "thinking tools" that can help you customize the right agile practices for any environment. Better, cheaper, faster software development. You can have all three–if you adopt the same lean principles that have already revolutionized manufacturing, logistics and product development. Iterating towards excellence: software development as an exercise in discovery Managing uncertainty: "decide as late as possible" by building change into the system. Compressing the value stream: rapid development, feedback, and improvement Empowering teams and individuals without compromising coordination Software with integrity: promoting coherence, usability, fitness, maintainability, and adaptability How to "see the whole"–even when your developers are scattered across multiple locations and contractors Simply put, Lean Software Development helps you refocus development on value, flow, and people–so you can achieve breakthrough quality, savings, speed, and business alignment.</p>

<p><em>Summary:</em> Great software architects aren’t born. They are a product of decades of building real-life solutions and relentless learning. They become really good at their trade closer to the retirement age. But most startups are fostered by young entrepreneurs who dare to try but lack the experience. They also lack the $$ to hire a silver-haired architect to join their team from day one. Left to their own faculties, the entrepreneurs and their engineering teams quickly get on the path of learning from their own mistakes. Eventually, they discover this is the most expensive way of learning. Over time they get better, and some become the true masters of the craft – but way too late to make a difference for their early-day projects. </p>
<p>This book is meant to break the vicious circle. It isn’t a textbook, at least not in the traditional sense. It is a business-centric practical guide to software architecture, intended for software engineers, technology executives, students of computer science, and tech-savvy entrepreneurs who want to de-risk their entrepreneurial endeavors or to fast-track their careers in software engineering. The recipes in this book are highly practical, battle-tested, and current for building mid- to large-scale systems in 2019.</p>

<p><em>Summary:</em> A classic book for professional embedded system designers, now in an affordable paperback edition. This book distills the experience of more than 90 design reviews on real embedded systems into a set of bite-size lessons learned in the areas of software development process, requirements, architecture, design, implementation, verification &amp; validation, and critical system properties. This is a concept book rather than a cut-and-paste the code book.Each chapter describes an area that tends to be a problem in embedded system design, symptoms that tend to indicate you need to make changes, the risks of not fixing problems in this area, and concrete ways to make your embedded system software better. Each of the 29 chapters is self-sufficient, permitting developers with a busy schedule to cherry-pick the best ideas to make their systems better right away.If you are relatively new to the area but have already learned the basics, this book will be an invaluable asset for taking your game to the next level. If you are experienced, this book provides a way to fill in any gaps. Once you have mastered this material, the book will serve as a source of reminders to make sure you haven't forgotten anything as you plan your next project. This is version 1.1 with some minor revisions from the 2010 hardcover edition. This is a paperback print-on-demand edition produced by Amazon.</p>

<p><em>Summary:</em> Successfully Implement High-Value Configuration Management Processes in Any Development Environment As IT systems have grown increasingly complex and mission-critical, effective configuration management (CM) has become critical to an organization's success. Using CM best practices, IT professionals can systematically manage change, avoiding unexpected problems introduced by changes to hardware, software, or networks. Now, today's best CM practices have been gathered in one indispensable resource showing you how to implement them throughout any agile or traditional development organization. Configuration Management Best Practices is practical, easy to understand and apply, and fully reflects the day-to-day realities faced by practitioners. Bob Aiello and Leslie Sachs thoroughly address all six "pillars" of CM: source code management, build engineering, environment configuration, change control, release engineering, and deployment. They demonstrate how to implement CM in ways that support software and systems development, meet compliance rules such as SOX and SAS-70, anticipate emerging standards such as IEEE/ISO 12207, and integrate with modern frameworks such as ITIL, COBIT, and CMMI. Coverage includes Using CM to meet business objectives, contractual requirements, and compliance rules Enhancing quality and productivity through lean processes and "just-in-time" process improvement Getting off to a good start in organizations without effective CM Implementing a Core CM Best Practices Framework that supports the entire development lifecycle Mastering the "people" side of CM: rightsizing processes, overcoming resistance, and understanding 
workplace psychology Architecting applications to take full advantage of CM best practices Establishing effective IT controls and compliance Managing tradeoffs and costs and avoiding expensive pitfalls Configuration Management Best Practices is the essential resource for everyone concerned with CM: from CTOs and CIOs to development, QA, and project managers and software engineers to analysts, testers, and compliance professionals. Praise for Configuration Management Best Practices "Understanding change is critical to any attempt to manage change. Bob Aiello and Leslie Sachs's Configuration Management Best Practices presents fundamental definitions and explanations to help practitioners understand change and its potential impact." -Mary Lou A. Hines Fritts, CIO and Vice Provost Academic Programs, University of Missouri-Kansas City "Few books on software configuration management emphasize the role of people and organizational context in defining and executing an effective SCM process. Bob Aiello and Leslie Sachs's book will give you the information you need not only to manage change effectively but also to manage the transition to a better SCM process." -Steve Berczuk, Agile Software Developer, and author of Software Configuration Management Patterns: Effective Teamwork, Practical Integration "Bob Aiello and Leslie Sachs succeed handsomely in producing an important book, at a practical and balanced level of detail, for this topic that often 'goes without saying' (and hence gets many projects into deep trouble). Their passion for the topic shows as they cover a wonderful range of topics-even culture, personality, and dealing with resistance to change-in an accessible form that can be applied to any project. The software industry has needed a book like this for a long time!" -Jim Brosseau, Clarrus Consulting Group, and author of Software Teamwork: Taking Ownership for Success "A must read for anyone developing or managing software or hardware projects. Bob Aiello and Leslie Sachs are able to bridge the language gap between the myriad of communities involved with successful Configuration Management implementations. They describe practical, real world practices that can be implemented by developers, managers, standard makers, and even Classical CM Folk." -Bob Ventimiglia, Bobev Consulting "A fresh and smart review of today's key concepts of SCM, build management, and related key practices on day-to-day software engineering. From the voice of an expert, Bob Aiello and Leslie Sachs offer an invaluable resource to success in SCM." -Pablo Santos Luaces, CEO of Codice Software "Bob Aiello and Leslie Sachs have a gift for stimulating the types of conversation and thought that necessarily precede needed organizational change. What they have to say is always interesting and often important." -Marianne Bays, Business Consultant, Manager and Educator</p>

<p><em>Summary:</em> Design Patterns is a modern classic in the literature of object-oriented development, offering timeless and elegant solutions to common problems in software design. It describes patterns for managing object creation, composing objects into larger structures, and coordinating control flow between objects. The book provides numerous examples where using composition rather than inheritance can improve the reusability and flexibility of code. Note, though, that it's not a tutorial but a catalog that you can use to find an object-oriented design pattern that's appropriate for the needs of your particular application--a selection for virtuoso programmers who appreciate (or require) consistent, well-engineered object-oriented designs.</p>

<p><em>Summary:</em> Software architecture—the conceptual glue that holds every phase of a project together for its many stakeholders—is widely recognized as a critical element in modern software development. Practitioners have increasingly discovered that close attention to a software system’s architecture pays valuable dividends. Without an architecture that is appropriate for the problem being solved, a project will stumble along or, most likely, fail. Even with a superb architecture, if that architecture is not well understood or well communicated the project is unlikely to succeed.</p>
<p>Documenting Software Architectures, Second Edition, provides the most complete and current guidance, independent of language or notation, on how to capture an architecture in a commonly understandable form. Drawing on their extensive experience, the authors first help you decide what information to document, and then, with guidelines and examples (in various notations, including UML), show you how to express an architecture so that others can successfully build, use, and maintain a system from it. The book features rules for sound documentation, the goals and strategies of documentation, architectural views and styles, documentation for software interfaces and software behavior, and templates for capturing and organizing information to generate a coherent package. New and improved in this second edition:</p>
<p>Coverage of architectural styles such as service-oriented architectures, multi-tier architectures, and data models
Guidance for documentation in an Agile development environment
Deeper treatment of documentation of rationale, reflecting best industrial practices
Improved templates, reflecting years of use and feedback, and more documentation layout options
A new, comprehensive example (available online), featuring documentation of a Web-based service-oriented system
Reference guides for three important architecture documentation languages: UML, AADL, and SySML</p>
<p>“This new edition is brighter, shinier, more complete, more pragmatic, more focused than the previous one, and I wouldn’t have thought it possible to improve on the original. As the field of software architecture has grown over these past decades, there is much more to be said, much more that we know, and much more that we can reflect upon of what’s worked and what hasn’t—and the authors here do all that, and more.”</p>

<p><em>Summary:</em> The New York Times bestseller that gives readers a paradigm-shattering new way to think about motivation </p>
<p>Most people believe that the best way to motivate is with rewards like money—the carrot-and-stick approach. That's a mistake, says Daniel H. Pink (author of To Sell Is Human: The Surprising Truth About Motivating Others). In this provocative and persuasive new book, he asserts that the secret to high performance and satisfaction-at work, at school, and at home—is the deeply human need to direct our own lives, to learn and create new things, and to do better by ourselves and our world.</p>
<p>Drawing on four decades of scientific research on human motivation, Pink exposes the mismatch between what science knows and what business does—and how that affects every aspect of life. He examines the three elements of true motivation—autonomy, mastery, and purpose-and offers smart and surprising techniques for putting these into action in a unique book that will change how we think and transform how we live.</p>

<p><em>Summary:</em> Barr Group's Embedded C Coding Standard was developed to help firmware engineers minimize defects in embedded systems. Unlike the majority of coding standards, this standard focuses on practical rules that keep bugs out - including techniques designed to improve the maintainability and portability of embedded software. The rules in this coding standard include a set of guiding principles, as well as specific naming conventions and other rules for the use of data types, functions, preprocessor macros, variables, and other C language constructs. Individual rules that have been demonstrated to reduce or eliminate certain types of defects are highlighted. The BARR-C standard is distinct from, yet compatible with, the MISRA C Guidelines for Use of the C Language in Critical Systems. Programmers can easily combine rules from the two standards as needed.</p>

<p><em>Summary:</em> Learn best practices for software development project management—and lead your teams and projects to success. Dr. Lawrence Peters is an industry-recognized expert with decades of experience conducting research and leading real-world software projects. Beyond getting the best developers, equipment, budget, and timeline possible—Peters concludes that no factor is more critical to project success than the manager’s role. Drawing on proven practices from allied industries such as business, psychology, accounting, and law, he describes a broader project-management methodology—with principles that software managers can readily adapt to help increase their own effectiveness and the productivity of their teams. Unlike other books on the topic, this book focuses squarely on the manager—and shows how to get results without adopting philosophies from Genghis Khan or Machiavelli. (There is mention of Godzilla, however.) Packed with real-world examples and pragmatic advice, this book shows any software development manager—new or experienced—how to lead teams in delivering the right results for their business.</p>

<p><em>Summary:</em> The latest edition of ISO 9001, published in 2015, is changing the way organisations are run worldwide. No longer is it sufficient simply to check on an organisation's quality management system: the revision demands that auditors assess the leadership and management of the quality system. This brings the standard alongside the widely proven system and process approach to continuing quality transformation that lies at the heart of the very best global companies.
Over a million registered organisations around the world need to engage with the revised requirements. If you work for one of them the changes may be significant. In Implementing ISO 9001:2015 business transformation experts Jan Gillett, Paul Simpson and Susannah Clarke take managers step-by-step through the process needed for successful transition, improving results and facilitating a smooth audit. By applying the principles and methodologies, and using the book's templates and questions with their teams and suppliers, managers will transform the performance of their organisations. The tangible benefits will pay for the transition many times over.
Implementing ISO 9001:2015 is a comprehensive guide to making the necessary transition to the new standard. The changes can also be used to stimulate transformation in organisations and their wider environments, coordinating processes to achieve both customer satisfaction and reduced operating costs. Follow this blueprint and certification comes as a free bonus!</p>

<p><em>Summary:</em> Solution architecture is concerned with the design and definition of (information technology) solutions so they can be subsequently implemented, used, operated and supported securely and efficiently. The solution exists to operate business processes in order to achieve business objectives, meet a business need and deliver business value. Solution architecture is concerned with engaging with the originating business function looking for the solution to create a solution vision and design a solution that meet their needs, subject to a range of constraints such as cost and affordability, time to deliver and organisational standards. The solution must exist as a coherent whole.Solutions must be designed consistently across the solution landscape and make optimum use of appropriate technologies. Solution architecture must focus on creating usable and useful solutions. Solution architecture must have a standard reliable approach to business engagements and the design of solution that emerge from them. Solution architecture must work collaboratively with other information technology functions - other architecture roles, business analysis and service management - to ensure continuity along the solution delivery journey.Effective solution architecture involves: -Have a depth and breadth of solution delivery and technical experience to be able to identify solution design options quickly-Being able to understand the detail of the solution while maintaining a view of the wider (and higher) context of the business need for the solution and being able to explain both these views of sets of information-Being able to communicate effectively with all parties - technical and business - involved in the solution design and delivery journey, assist with decision-making, be realistic and make appropriate compromises and design choices in order to create the best solution design-Being able to apply technology appropriately and with selective innovation (and the desire to constantly acquire new knowledge and ways of applying technology)-Being involved in the solution delivery journey along its entire length-Being able to be the solution advocate and subject matter expertThis book is aimed at a variety of potential readers: -Existing solution architects who want to have a more theoretical and a broader understanding of their role-Existing or new managers of solution architecture functions who want to create a high-performing practice within their organisations and who want to articulate the benefits and value solution architect can contribute to the information technology function and the wider business and the potential it can offer to the business organisation-Mangers of information technology functions who want to understand what solution architecture is, where it fits into the wider architecture context and disciplines and solution delivery and operation and the value it can contribute to both the information technology function and the wider business-Other information technology architects who want to understand how the architecture disciplines can work together to deliver value-Business analysts and managers of business analysis functions who want to understand how they can work more closely with the solution architecture function in order to provide the business with a better overall service-Other information technology personnel who want to move into solution architecture and who want to understand what it is-Consulting organisations and individuals who want to develop and offer value-adding solution architecture services</p>

<p><em>Summary:</em> Few books on software project management have been as influential and timeless as The Mythical Man-Month. With a blend of software engineering facts and thought-provoking opinions, Fred Brooks offers insight for anyone managing complex projects. These essays draw from his experience as project manager for the IBM System/360 computer family and then for OS/360, its massive software system. Now, 45 years after the initial publication of his book, Brooks has revisited his original ideas and added new thoughts and advice, both for readers already familiar with his work and for readers discovering it for the first time.</p>
<p>The added chapters contain (1) a crisp condensation of all the propositions asserted in the original book, including Brooks' central argument in The Mythical Man-Month: that large programming projects suffer management problems different from small ones due to the division of labor; that the conceptual integrity of the product is therefore critical; and that it is difficult but possible to achieve this unity; (2) Brooks' view of these propositions a generation later; (3) a reprint of his classic 1986 paper "No Silver Bullet"; and (4) today's thoughts on the 1986 assertion, "There will be no silver bullet within ten years."</p>

<p><em>Summary:</em> Written by networking veteran with 20 years of experience, Network Warrior provides a thorough and practical introduction to the entire network infrastructure, from cabling to the routers. What you need to learn to pass a Cisco certification exam such as CCNA and what you need to know to survive in the real world are two very different things. The strategies that this book offers weren 't on the exam, but they 're exactly what you need to do your job well. Network Warrior takes you step by step through the world of hubs, switches, firewalls, and more, including ways to troubleshoot a congested network, and when to upgrade and why. Along the way, you 'll gain an historical perspective of various networking features, such as the way Ethernet evolved. Based on the author 's own experience as well as those he worked for and with, Network Warrior is a Cisco-centric book, focused primarily on the TCP/IP protocol and Ethernet networks -- the realm that Cisco Systems now dominates. The book covers: The type of networks now in use, from LANs, WANs and MANs to CANs The OSI Model and the layers involved in sending data Hubs, repeaters, switches, and trunks in practice Auto negotiation and why it 's a common problem in network slowdowns Route maps, routing protocols, and switching algorithms in Cisco routers The resilient Ethernet -- how to make things truly redundant Cisco 6500 multi-layer switches and the Catalyst 3750 switch Telecom nomenclature -- why it 's different from the data world T1 and DS3 Firewall theory, designing access lists, authentication in Cisco devices Server load balancing technology Content switch module in action Designing QOS and what QOS does not do IP design and subnetting made easy The book also explains how to sell your ideas to management, how networks become a mess as a company grows, and why change control is your friend. Network Warrior will help network administrators and engineers win the complex battles they face every day.</p>

Authors Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister include plenty of illustrative, often amusing anecdotes; their writing is light, conversational, and filled with equal portions of humor and wisdom, and there is a refreshing absence of "new age" terms and multistep programs. The advice is presented straightforwardly and ranges from simple issues of prioritization to complex ways of engendering harmony and productivity in your team. Peopleware is a short read that delivers more than many books on the subject twice its size.</p>

<p><em>Summary:</em> One of the toughest challenges software architects face is to effectively document their systems and architectures. Yet this is also one of their most "crucial" challenges, because ambiguous, incomplete, or inaccurate documentation leads directly to failures in design and implementation. Now, pioneering IBM senior architect Tilak Mitra offers the first complete guide to writing architectural documentation that is clear, crisp, accurate, non-redundant, and "usable." This is the only book to provide detailed prescriptive and pragmatic guidance for documenting any real-world IT project, regardless of system, methodology, or environment. Mitra specifically identifies the artifacts that require documentation, showing how to fully communicate your solution to stakeholders, and enable implementers to move confidently from macro-level to micro-level design. Step by step, Mitra addresses key architectural aspects including: system context, function, operations, infrastructure, integration, performance, capacity planning, SOA, and more. He shows how to avoid "over-engineering" and excessive documentation that can delay project delivery and increase risk, while ensuring that designers and developers "always" have the accurate and specific guidance they need.</p>

<p><em>Summary:</em> This book provides a state-of-the-art perspective on intelligent process-aware information systems and presents chapters on specific facets and approaches applicable to such systems. Further, it highlights novel advances and developments in various aspects of intelligent process-aware information systems and business process management systems. Intelligence capabilities are increasingly being integrated into or created in many of today’s software products and services. Process-aware information systems provide critical computing infrastructure to support the various processes involved in the creation and delivery of business products and services. Yet the integration of intelligence capabilities into process-aware information systems is a non-trivial yet necessary evolution of these complex systems. The book’s individual chapters address adaptive process management, case management processes, autonomically-capable processes, process-oriented information logistics, process recommendations, reasoning over process models, process portability, and business process intelligence. The primary target groups are researchers and PhD/Master students in the field of information systems.</p>

<p><em>Published Date:</em> 2000</p>
<p><em>Pages:</em> 239.0</p>
<p><em>ISBN:</em> 9780201657883</p>
<p><em>Summary:</em> "The first edition of Programming Pearls was one of the most influential books I read early in my career, and many of the insights I first encountered in that book stayed with me long after I read it. Jon has done a wonderful job of updating the material. I am very impressed at how fresh the new examples seem." 
- Steve McConnell, author, Code Complete</p>
<p>When programmers list their favorite books, Jon Bentley's collection of programming pearls is commonly included among the classics. Just as natural pearls grow from grains of sand that irritate oysters, programming pearls have grown from real problems that have irritated real programmers. With origins beyond solid engineering, in the realm of insight and creativity, Bentley's pearls offer unique and clever solutions to those nagging problems. Illustrated by programs designed as much for fun as for instruction, the book is filled with lucid and witty descriptions of practical programming techniques and fundamental design principles. It is not at all surprising that Programming Pearls has been so highly valued by programmers at every level of experience. </p>
<p>In this revision, the first in 14 years, Bentley has substantially updated his essays to reflect current programming methods and environments. In addition, there are three new essays on (1) testing, debugging, and timing; (2) set representations; and (3) string problems. All the original programs have been rewritten, and an equal amount of new code has been generated. Implementations of all the programs, in C or C++, are now available on the Web.</p>
<p>What remains the same in this new edition is Bentley's focus on the hard core of programming problems and his delivery of workable solutions to those problems. Whether you are new to Bentley's classic or are revisiting his work for some fresh insight, this book is sure to make your own list of favorites.</p>

A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK Guide)Third Edition is the map to get you there. In 1983, Project Management Institute (PMI) volunteers first sat down to distill the project management body of knowledge. Today, the PMBOK Guide has become a global standard for the project management profession and is one of the best, most versatile documents available across major industries. It contains the fundamental, baseline practices that drive business results for any organization. The third edition has been updated to reflect the most current industry knowledge and practices. One of the most important changes is the evolution from generally accepted on most projects, most of the time to generally recognized as good practice on most projects, most of the time. Several chapters have been updated, rewritten or expanded to include the most current and pressing information facing project managers today. It also includes an expanded index and glossary. The PMBOK GuideThird Edition reflects the collaboration and knowledge of project management leaders who deliver business results. Successful project management is a constant advantage in the dynamic nature of todays organizations. Companies, non-profits, and government agencies around the world are turning to project management to achieve corporate strategic objectives.

<p><em>ISBN:</em> 9781556159008</p>
<p><em>Summary:</em> A fundamental software engineering project management guide based on the practical requirements of "Taming Wild Software Schedules". Emphasizes possible, realistic and "best practice" approaches for managers, technical leads and self-managed teams. The author emphasizes efficient development concepts with an examination of rapid development strategies and a study of classic mistakes, within the context of software-development fundamentals and risk management. Dissects the core issues of rapid development, lifecycle planning, estimation and scheduling. Contains very good and practical discussions of customer-oriented development, motivation and teamwork. Explains such fundamental requirements as team structure, feature-set control (the dreaded feature creep in every project), availability and use of productivity tools and project recovery options. Relevant case studies are analyzed and discussed within the context of specific software development problems. Over 200 pages in this publication are devoted to a summary of best practices, everything from the daily build and smoke test, through prototyping, model selection, measurement, reuse, and the top-10 risks list. </p>
<p>This publication is definitely recommended and will become a classic in the field, just as the author's prior publication, "Code Complete" already is.</p>

<p><em>Summary:</em> If you are a leader - or aspiring to be one - then tools like PowerPoint detract, not add, to how your performance will be received. In fact, leadership and the ability to speak and sell yourself and your ideas are inextricably intertwined. Successful leaders speak to help listeners know themselves as well as to influence and inspire them. Chris Witt has helped hundreds of executives take their game to another level. Because, when you are a leader, being a good speaker isn't enough. You have to be a great speaker. Your reputation and the success of your business depend on being able to speak to a variety of audiences confidently and persuasively. Through contemporary and historical examples, Chris provides practical advice on how his readers can take their game to another level by understanding ideas such as: * You are the message - it's your experience, vision and character that audiences want * As a leader, you have only three speeches: to identify, to influence and to inspire * Speak less to say more. Fewer, shorter speeches have greater impact * Dare to be different. Leaders don't play by the rules; they take risks</p>

<p><em>Summary:</em> A Lifetime of Invaluable Management Insights from Legendary Software Quality Guru Watts S. Humphrey In 1986, Watts S. Humphrey made an outrageous commitment: a promise to transform software development. As the pioneering innovator behind SEI's Capability Maturity Model (CMM), Personal Software Process (PSP), and Team Software Process (TSP), Humphrey has more than met that promise. But his contributions go beyond methodology: For decades, his deeply personal writings on project management have been admired by software engineers worldwide. Reflections on Management brings together Humphrey's best and most influential essays and articles--sharing insights that will be indispensable for anyone who must achieve superior results in software or any other endeavor. Collected here for the first time, these works offer compelling insights into everything from planning day-to-day work to improving quality, encouraging teamwork to becoming a truly great leader. All of these writings share a powerful vision, grounded by a life in software that has extended across nearly six decades. The vision is this: To succeed, professionals must effectively manage for more than plans, schedules, and code--they must manage teams, bosses, and above all, themselves.</p>

<p><em>ISBN:</em> 9780957587403</p>
<p><em>Summary:</em> The basics of being a ScrumMaster are fairly straightforward: Facilitate the Scrum process and remove impediments. But being a great ScrumMaster, one who truly embodies the principles of servant-leadership and helps move a team to the high performance levels possible with Scrum, is much harder and much more elusive. In his over ten years of coaching numerous Scrum teams, the highly-respected and experienced Scrum coach Geoff Watts has identified patterns that separate a good ScrumMaster from a great one. In this book, he not only illustrates these patterns through stories of his own experiences and those of the many Scrum teams he has encountered but offers practical guidance for you on your own path to greatness.</p>
<p>In this book you will learn:
The skills and characteristics of great ScrumMasters
How to generate, maintain and increase engagement from the team
How to increase the effectiveness of the Scrum meetings, such as retrospectives and daily scrums.
How to foster a more creative and collaborative team
How to increase the performance of the team
How to know when you are a successful ScrumMaster\</p>
<p>Scrum Mastery is for practicing ScrumMasters who want to develop themselves into a great servant-leader capable of taking their teams beyond simple process compliance.</p>
<p>Comments on the book</p>
<p>Mike Cohn, in his foreword for the book, said:</p>
<p>"Most books rehash well-trod territory and I don’t finish them any wiser. I am positive I will be referring back to this book for many years" </p>
<p>Roman Pichler, author of Agile Product Management with Scrum: Creating Products That Customers Love said:</p>
<p>"I am thoroughly impressed with how comprehensive and well-written the book is. It will be indispensable for many people"</p>
<p>Jean Tabaka, Agile Fellow, Rally Software:</p>
<p>"Geoff brings us a personal and inspired peak into what truly moves us from good to great: great in how we serve; great in how we lead; great in how we create mastery in our teams and organizations; and, great in how we recognize the impediments to our own growth to greatness. Scrum mastery is a skill that can be honed and Geoff gives us rich tools to sharpen our craft."</p>

<p><em>Summary:</em> To most companies, efficiency means profits and growth. But what if your “efficient” company—the one with the reduced headcount and the “stretch” goals—is actually slowing down and losing money? What if your employees are burning out doing the work of two or more people, leaving them no time for planning, prioritizing, or even lunch? What if you’re losing employees faster than you can hire them? What if your superefficient company is suddenly falling behind? Tom DeMarco, a leading management consultant to both Fortune 500 and up-and-coming companies, has discovered a counterintuitive principle that explains why efficiency improvement can sometimes make a company slow. If your real organizational goal is to become fast (responsive and agile), then he proposes that what you need is not more efficiency, but more slack. What is “slack”? Slack is the degree of freedom in a company that allows it to change. It could be something as simple as adding an assistant to a department, letting high-priced talent spend less time at the photo copier and more time making key decisions. Slack could also appear in the way a company treats employees: instead of loading them up with overwork, a company designed with slack allows its people room to breathe, increase effectiveness, and reinvent themselves. In thirty—three short chapters filled with creative learning tools and charts, you and your company can learn how to: ∑make sense of the Efficiency/Flexibility quandary ∑run directly toward risk instead of away from it ∑strengthen the creative role of middle management ∑make change and growth work together for even greater profits A innovative approach that works for new- and old-economy companies alike, this revolutionary handbook will debunk commonly held assumptions about real-world management, and give you and your company a brand-new model for achieving and maintaining true effectiveness—and a healthier bottom line.</p>

<p><em>Summary:</em> This award-winning book, substantially updated to reflect the latest developments in the field, introduces the concepts and best practices of software architecture—how a software system is structured and how that system's elements are meant to interact. Distinct from the details of implementation, algorithm, and data representation, an architecture holds the key to achieving system quality, is a reusable asset that can be applied to subsequent systems, and is crucial to a software organization's business strategy.</p>
<p>Drawing on their own extensive experience, the authors cover the essential technical topics for designing, specifying, and validating a system. They also emphasize the importance of the business context in which large systems are designed. Their aim is to present software architecture in a real-world setting, reflecting both the opportunities and constraints that companies encounter. To that end, case studies that describe successful architectures illustrate key points of both technical and organizational discussions.</p>
<p>Topics new to this edition include:</p>
<p>Architecture design and analysis, including the Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM)     Capturing quality requirements and achieving them through quality scenarios and tactics     Using architecture reconstruction to recover undocumented architectures     Documenting architectures using the Unified Modeling Language (UML)     New case studies, including Web-based examples and a wireless Enterprise JavaBeans™ (EJB) system designed to support wearable computers     The financial aspects of architectures, including use of the Cost Benefit Analysis Method (CBAM) to make decisions </p>
<p>If you design, develop, or manage the building of large software systems (or plan to do so), or if you are interested in acquiring such systems for your corporation or government agency, use Software Architecture in Practice, Second Edition, to get up to speed on the current state of software architecture.</p>

<p><em>Summary:</em> Architects are often harried because they have no clean, easy decisions: everything is an awful tradeoff between two or more less than perfect alternatives. These are the difficult problems architects face, what this book's authors call the hard parts. These topics have no best practices, forcing architects to understand various tradeoffs to succeed. This book discusses these hard parts by not only investigating what makes architecture so difficult, but also by providing proven ways to address these problems and make them easier.</p>
<p>The book explores topics such as choosing an appropriate architecture, deciding on service granularity, managing workflows and orchestration, managing and decoupling contracts, managing distributed transactions, and optimizing operational characteristics such as scalability, elasticity, and performance. As practicing consultants, the authors focus on questions they commonly hear architects ask and provide techniques that enable them to discover the tradeoffs necessary to answer these questions.</p>

<p><em>ISBN:</em> 9780321927866</p>
<p><em>Summary:</em> The Systems Modeling Language (SysML) extends UML with powerful systems engineering capabilities for modeling a wider spectrum of systems and capturing all aspects of a system's design. SysML Distilled is the first clear, concise guide for everyone who wants to start creating effective SysML models.</p>
<p>(Drawing on his pioneering experience at Lockheed Martin and NASA, Lenny Delligatti illuminates SysML's core components and provides practical advice to help you create good models and good designs. Delligatti begins with an easy-to-understand overview of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and an explanation of how SysML enables effective system specification, analysis, design, optimization, verification, and validation. Next, he shows how to use all nine types of SysML diagrams, even if you have no previous experience with modeling languages. A case study running through the text demonstrates the use of SysML in modeling a complex, real-world sociotechnical system.</p>
<p>Modeled after Martin Fowler's classic UML Distilled, Delligatti's indispensable guide quickly teaches you what you need to know to get started and helps you deepen your knowledge incrementally as the need arises. Like SysML itself, the book is method independent and is designed to support whatever processes, procedures, and tools you already use.</p>
<p>Coverage Includes 
Why SysML was created and the business case for using it Quickly putting SysML to practical use What to know before you start a SysML modeling project Essential concepts that apply to all SysML diagrams SysML diagram elements and relationships Diagramming block definitions, internal structures, use cases, activities, interactions, state machines, constraints, requirements, and packages Using allocations to define mappings among elements across a model SysML notation tables, version changes, and sources for more information </p>

<p><em>Summary:</em> This book is meant to help the reader learn how to program in C. It is the definitive reference guide, now in a second edition. Although the first edition was written in 1978, it continues to be a worldwide best-seller. This second edition brings the classic original up to date to include the ANSI standard. </p>
<p>From the Preface: 
We have tried to retain the brevity of the first edition. C is not a big language, and it is not well served by a big book. We have improved the exposition of critical features, such as pointers, that are central to C programming. We have refined the original examples, and have added new examples in several chapters. For instance, the treatment of complicated declarations is augmented by programs that convert declarations into words and vice versa. As before, all examples have been tested directly from the text, which is in machine-readable form. </p>
<p>As we said in the first preface to the first edition, C "wears well as one's experience with it grows." With a decade more experience, we still feel that way. We hope that this book will help you to learn C and use it well.</p>

<p><em>Pages:</em> 322.0</p>
<p><em>ISBN:</em> 9780321861276</p>
<p><em>Summary:</em> The Object-Oriented Thought Process, Fourth Edition An introduction to object-oriented concepts for developers looking to master modern application practices Object-oriented programming (OOP) is the foundation of modern programming languages, including C++, Java, C#, Visual Basic .NET, Ruby, and Objective-C. Objects also form the basis for many web technologies such as JavaScript, Python, and PHP. It is of vital importance to learn the fundamental concepts of object orientation before starting to use object-oriented development environments. OOP promotes good design practices, code portability, and reuse–but it requires a shift in thinking to be fully understood. Programmers new to OOP should resist the temptation to jump directly into a particular programming language (such as Objective-C, VB .NET, C++, C# .NET, or Java) or a modeling language (such as UML), and instead first take the time to learn what author Matt Weisfeld calls “the object-oriented thought process.” Written by a developer for developers who want to make the leap to object-oriented technologies, The Object-Oriented Thought Process provides a solutions-oriented approach to object-oriented programming. Readers will learn to understand the proper uses of inheritance and composition, the difference between aggregation and association, and the important distinction between interfaces and implementations. While programming technologies have been changing and evolving over the years, object-oriented concepts remain a constant–no matter what the platform. This revised edition focuses on interoperability across programming technologies, whether you are using objects in traditional application design, in XML-based data transactions, in web page development, in mobile apps, or in any modern programming environment. “Programmers who aim to create high quality software–as all programmers should–must learn the varied subtleties of the familiar yet not so familiar beasts called objects and classes. Doing so entails careful study of books such as Matt Weisfeld’s The Object-Oriented Thought Process.” –Bill McCarty, author of Java Distributed Objects, and Object-Oriented Design in Java Contents at a Glance 1 Introduction to Object-Oriented Concepts 2 How to Think in Terms of Objects 3 Advanced Object-Oriented Concepts 4 The Anatomy of a Class 5 Class Design Guidelines 6 Designing with Objects 7 Mastering Inheritance and Composition 8 Frameworks and Reuse: Designing with Interfaces and Abstract Classes 9 Building Objects and Object-Oriented Design 10 Creating Object Models 11 Objects and Portable Data: XML and JSON 12 Persistent Objects: Serialization, Marshaling, and Relational Databases 13 Objects in Web Services, Mobile Apps, and Hybrids 14 Objects and Client/Server Applications 15 Design Patterns</p>

<p><em>Summary:</em> Success in today's IT environment requires you to view your career as a business endeavor. In this book, you'll learn how to become an entrepreneur, driving your career in the direction of your choosing. You'll learn how to build your software development career step by step, following the same path that you would follow if you were building, marketing, and selling a product. After all, your skills themselves are a product. The choices you make about which technologies to focus on and which business domains to master have at least as much impact on your success as your technical knowledge itself--don't let those choices be accidental. We'll walk through all aspects of the decision-making process, so you can ensure that you're investing your time and energy in the right areas. You'll develop a structured plan for keeping your mind engaged and your skills fresh. You'll learn how to assess your skills in terms of where they fit on the value chain, driving you away from commodity skills and toward those that are in high demand. Through a mix of high-level, thought-provoking essays and tactical "Act on It" sections, you will come away with concrete plans you can put into action immediately. You'll also get a chance to read the perspectives of several highly successful members of our industry from a variety of career paths. As with any product or service, if nobody knows what you're selling, nobody will buy. We'll walk through the often-neglected world of marketing, and you'll create a plan to market yourself both inside your company and to the industry in general. Above all, you'll see how you can set the direction of your career, leading to a more fulfilling and remarkable professional life.</p>

<p><em>Summary:</em> In all the books on leadership skills, one key element is consistently missing – the leader's psychology. For the first time, this book sets out a compact, but complete model for successful leadership based on an understanding of the psychological challenges and hidden inner blocks faced by all leaders. Drawing on his experience as a CEO and then as an executive coach, the author has created two new groundbreaking models. The first outlines the three levels of leadership. The other explains the human mind and how to achieve self-mastery. Clearly written with no unnecessary padding, packed with practical tools and backed up by research, this book shows how all leaders can rise to the challenge.</p>

<p><em>Summary:</em> Model inference is often based on a single best models, despite modern computers easily can process many models concurrently. One reason is the manual labour involved. Managing model ensembles can become tedious when performed manually. This work presents the software design and a prototype that is concerned to facilitate that task. Requirements are discussed and examples given. Practitioners who do not shy away from interactive ensemble model management will certainly benefit from these ideas. Other readers are welcome to re-check with model ensembles and see the myth of tedious labour dissolving.</p>

Take three techs, two salespeople, a designer, two executives, a couple of administrative staff, mix in a mischievous Artificial Intelligence and a "dust puppy" born from the innards of a mega server, put them all together in a crowded little office, and you have the makings of one of the most off-beat, original, and funny comic strips to come along in years.User Friendly reads like Dilbert for the open-source community. Already in syndication in The National Post, one of Canada's leading national newspapers, and with a massive online following, it provides outsiders a lighthearted look at the world of the hard- core geek, and allows those who make their living dwelling in this world a chance to laugh at themselves.</p>

<p><em>Summary:</em> An introduction to Lean thinking Lean is a mindset rather than a methodology; it is a way of thinking based on practices, strategies, tools and methods that can be applied to maximise value and minimise waste while ensuring that processes achieve corporate goals. Lean helps organisations in all sectors achieve their objectives by facilitating a long-term culture shift focusing on three fundamental areas: waste , customer value and continuous incremental improvement. A good assurance review will ensure that resources are being applied efficiently and effectively to achieve these objectives. Product overview Fundamentals of Assurance for Lean Projects explains the fundamental concepts of Lean and how they can be applied to any project, including software development and organisational change. It explains the jargon and dispels the mystique that surrounds Lean, providing readers with guidance and tips on performing audits or assurance reviews for Lean projects. It also describes how Lean fits with Agile and Kanban, and how it can be combined with Six Sigma to create an efficient, high-quality approach. The book provides strong practical guidance for those tasked with providing assurance for Lean projects. Read this book to learn about the approach and principles of Lean, the governance of Lean projects, and Lean audit and review. Topics covered include: The five main Lean principles and their significance.Tools used for root-cause analysis (the five whys and fishbone analysis).Defining and modelling customer value, and innovative responses to customer needs (the Kano model).Common causes of waste and how to improve flow.Customer pull and Kanban mechanisms to manage the associated flow of processing and information.The pursuit of perfection (Kaikaku and Kaizen) and total quality management (TQM).The application of Lean principles to software development.Practical suggestions for approaches to auditing. As with all books in the Fundamentals Series, Fundamentals of Assurance for Lean Projects introduces the subject and includes references for those who would like to further investigate specific areas.</p>

<p><em>Summary:</em> 
Fatbrain Review Explains Microsoft's techniques for developing bug free C programs and provides practical approaches to the prevention and automatic detection of errors. Focus is on an in-depth analysis and exposition of not-so-obvious coding errors in the sample code provided. The theme is to answer the questions 'How couild I have automatically detected this bug' and 'How could I have prevented this bug'? Chapters include programmer attitudes, techniques and debugging methodology. A particularly revealing chapter is "Treacheries of the Trade", should be required reading for all C maniacs. The author has been a professional programmer for seventeen years and draws heavily (and candidly) on actual coding problems and practices based on years of experience at Microsoft.</p>
