Although he has been widely published within his specialized field, A Brief History of Time is the first work he has written for the non-mathematical layman. In it he explores the outer reaches of our knowledge of astrophysics and the nature of time and the universe. The result is a revelation: a book that not only serves as an introduction to today's most important theories on the cosmos but affords a unique opportunity to experience one of the most imaginative and influential thinkers of our age.

Confined to a wheelchair for the last twenty years by a motor-neurone disease, Professor Hawking is best known for his work on black holes. But here he turns his mind to the biggest question of all: the search for a unified theory that combines general relativity and quantum mechanics.

Always in the clearest, most accessible terms, Stephen Hawking reviews the great theories of the cosmos. From Galileo and Newton to Einstein and Poincaré, and then moves on into deepest space for the greatest intellectual adventure of all. Could time run backwards? Will a ""no boundary"" universe replace the big bang theory? What happens in a universe with eleven dimensions? These are just some of the questions considered with devastating lucidity and brilliance in A Brief History of Time, a work that is bound to become a classic of its kind.","","2.8","Cosmology","4.21","09/18/2023","","","","","","","","Science"

Estimating the accuracy of that result is often regarded by students as an obscure and tedious routine, involving much arithmetic. An estimate of the error is, however, an integral part of the presentation of the results of experiments. This textbook is intended for undergraduates who are carrying out laboratory experiments in the physical sciences for the first time. It is a practical guide on how to analyse data and estimate errors. The necessary formulas for performing calculations are given, and the ideas behind them are explained, although this is not a formal text on statistics. Specific examples are worked through step by step in the text. Emphasis is placed on the need to think about whether a calculated error is sensible. At first students should take this book with them to the laboratory, and the format is intended to make this convenient. The book will provide the necessary understanding of what is involved, should inspire confidence in the method of estimating errors, and enable numerical calculations without too much effort. The author's aim is to make practical classes more enjoyable. Students who use this book will be able to complete their calculations quickly and confidently, leaving time to appreciate the basic physical ideas involved in the experiments.","","","Science","3.48","09/18/2023","","","","","","","","Science"

Adrenaline junkies, dead fish, project sluts, true believers, Lewis and Clark, template zombies . . . Most developers, testers, and managers on IT projects are pretty good at recognizing patterns of behavior and gut-level hunches, as in, “I sense that this project is headed for disaster.” But it has always been more difficult to transform these patterns and hunches into a usable form, something a team can debate, refine, and use. Until now. In Adrenaline Junkies and Template Zombies, the six principal consultants of The Atlantic Systems Guild present the patterns of behavior they most often observe at the dozens of IT firms they transform each year, around the world. The result is a quick-read guide to identifying nearly ninety typical scenarios, drawing on a combined one-hundred-and-fifty years of project management experience. Project by project, you’ll improve the accuracy of your hunches and your ability to act on them. The patterns are presented in an easy-reference format, with names designed to ease communication with your teammates. In just a few words, you can describe what’s happening on your project. Citing the patterns of behavior can help you quickly move those above and below you to the next step on your project. You’ll find classic patterns such as these: News Improvement Management by Mood Ring Piling On Rattle Yer Dags Natural Authority Food++ Fridge Door and more than eighty more! Not every pattern will be evident in your organization, and not every pattern is necessarily good or bad. However, you’ll find many patterns that will apply to your current and future assignments, even in the most ambiguous circumstances. When you assess your situation and follow your next hunch, you'll have the collective wisdom of six world-class consultants at your side.","","","Management","3.98","08/15/2023","","","","","","","","IT related"

Robert Oppenheimer, ""father of the atomic bomb,"" the brilliant, charismatic physicist who led the effort to capture the awesome fire of the sun for his country in time of war. Immediately after Hiroshima, he became the most famous scientist of his generation-one of the iconic figures of the twentieth century, the embodiment of modern man confronting the consequences of scientific progress. 

He was the author of a radical proposal to place international controls over atomic materials-an idea that is still relevant today. He opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb and criticized the Air Force's plans to fight an infinitely dangerous nuclear war. In the now almost-forgotten hysteria of the early 1950s, his ideas were anathema to powerful advocates of a massive nuclear buildup, and, in response, Atomic Energy Commission chairman Lewis Strauss, Superbomb advocate Edward Teller and FBI director J. Edgar Hoover worked behind the scenes to have a hearing board find that Oppenheimer could not be trusted with America's nuclear secrets. 

American Prometheus sets forth Oppenheimer's life and times in revealing and unprecedented detail. Exhaustively researched, it is based on thousands of records and letters gathered from archives in America and abroad, on massive FBI files and on close to a hundred interviews with Oppenheimer's friends, relatives and colleagues.

We follow him from his earliest education at the turn of the twentieth century at New York City's Ethical Culture School, through personal crises at Harvard and Cambridge universities. Then to Germany, where he studied quantum physics with the world's most accomplished theorists; and to Berkeley, California, where he established, during the 1930s, the leading American school of theoretical physics, and where he became deeply involved with social justice causes and their advocates, many of whom were communists. Then to Los Alamos, New Mexico, where he transformed a bleak mesa into the world's most potent nuclear weapons laboratory-and where he himself was transformed. And finally, to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, which he directed from 1947 to 1966. 

American Prometheus is a rich evocation of America at mid-century, a new and compelling portrait of a brilliant, ambitious, complex and flawed man profoundly connected to its major events—the Depression, World War II and the Cold War. It is at once biography and history, and essential to our understanding of our recent past—and of our choices for the future.","","16.99","Kellogg's","4.25","09/18/2023","","","","","","","","Biographies"

They are a product of decades of building real-life solutions and relentless learning. They become really good at their trade closer to the retirement age. But most startups are fostered by young entrepreneurs who dare to try but lack the experience. They also lack the $$ to hire a silver-haired architect to join their team from day one. Left to their own faculties, the entrepreneurs and their engineering teams quickly get on the path of learning from their own mistakes. Eventually, they discover this is the most expensive way of learning. Over time they get better, and some become the true masters of the craft – but way too late to make a difference for their early-day projects. 

This book is meant to break the vicious circle. It isn’t a textbook, at least not in the traditional sense. It is a business-centric practical guide to software architecture, intended for software engineers, technology executives, students of computer science, and tech-savvy entrepreneurs who want to de-risk their entrepreneurial endeavors or to fast-track their careers in software engineering.

Which of these bizarre phenomena, if any, can really exist in our universe? Black holes, down which anything can fall but from which nothing can return; wormholes, short spacewarps connecting regions of the cosmos; singularities, where space and time are so violently warped that time ceases to exist and space becomes a kind of foam; gravitational waves, which carry symphonic accounts of collisions of black holes billions of years ago; and time machines, for traveling backward and forward in time.

Kip Thorne, along with fellow theorists Stephen Hawking and Roger Penrose, a cadre of Russians, and earlier scientists such as Oppenheimer, Wheeler and Chandrasekhar, has been in the thick of the quest to secure answers. In this masterfully written and brilliantly informed work of scientific history and explanation, Dr. Thorne, the Feynman Professor of Theoretical Physics at Caltech, leads his readers through an elegant, always human, tapestry of interlocking themes, coming finally to a uniquely informed answer to the great question: what principles control our universe and why do physicists think they know the things they think they know? Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time has been one of the greatest best-sellers in publishing history. Anyone who struggled with that book will find here a more slowly paced but equally mind-stretching experience, with the added fascination of a rich historical and human component.","","3.1","Relativity","4.22","09/18/2023","","","","","","","","Science"

A world-class physicist and a citizen scientist combine forces to teach Physics 101—the DIY way

The Theoretical Minimum is a book for anyone who has ever regretted not taking physics in college—or who simply wants to know how to think like a physicist. In this unconventional introduction, physicist Leonard Susskind and hacker-scientist George Hrabovsky offer a first course in physics and associated math for the ardent amateur. Unlike most popular physics books—which give readers a taste of what physicists know but shy away from equations or math—Susskind and Hrabovsky actually teach the skills you need to do physics, beginning with classical mechanics, yourself. Based on Susskind's enormously popular Stanford University-based (and YouTube-featured) continuing-education course, the authors cover the minimum—the theoretical minimum of the title—that readers need to master to study more advanced topics.

An alternative to the conventional go-to-college method, The Theoretical Minimum provides a tool kit for amateur scientists to learn physics at their own pace.

These behaviours are the hallmark of mentally tough, emotionally intelligent players, and can be grouped under the 5Cs of: Commitment, Communication, Concentration, Control, and Confidence. The 5Cs, however, are rarely innate - they are a product of a player's long-term psycho-social development and, crucially, they can be coached and nurtured. The aim of the 5Cs program, in this book, is to show coaches how to develop these important psycho-social skills and help young players to understand how they can truly achieve their potential. Written specifically for soccer coaches of all levels, Coaching Psychological Skills in Youth Football details each C in a methodical and practical manner with real-world exercises for training and matches. The book is relevant to soccer coaches working with 5-16 year-old players, with individual techniques and practices marked for appropriate age groups. By weaving these techniques into their normal coaching practice, coaches will help educate young players to optimise their motivation, discipline, composure, self-belief and teamwork. A complete 12 month development plan is included alongside a case study from a youth coach who has actually experienced the 5C journey. Coaching Psychological Skills in Youth Football will build your confidence as a coach as you learn how to grow and apply a world-class knowledge of sport psychology in youth football.","","23.33","Books Global Store","4.25","09/18/2023","","","","","","","","Football"

Using CM best practices, IT professionals can systematically manage change, avoiding unexpected problems introduced by changes to hardware, software, or networks. Now, today's best CM practices have been gathered in one indispensable resource showing you how to implement them throughout any agile or traditional development organization. Configuration Management Best Practices is practical, easy to understand and apply, and fully reflects the day-to-day realities faced by practitioners. Bob Aiello and Leslie Sachs thoroughly address all six ""pillars"" of CM: source code management, build engineering, environment configuration, change control, release engineering, and deployment. They demonstrate how to implement CM in ways that support software and systems development, meet compliance rules such as SOX and SAS-70, anticipate emerging standards such as IEEE/ISO 12207, and integrate with modern frameworks such as ITIL, COBIT, and CMMI. Coverage includes Using CM to meet business objectives, contractual requirements, and compliance rules Enhancing quality and productivity through lean processes and ""just-in-time"" process improvement Getting off to a good start in organizations without effective CM Implementing a Core CM Best Practices Framework that supports the entire development lifecycle Mastering the ""people"" side of CM: rightsizing processes, overcoming resistance, and understanding 
workplace psychology Architecting applications to take full advantage of CM best practices Establishing effective IT controls and compliance Managing tradeoffs and costs and avoiding expensive pitfalls Configuration Management Best Practices is the essential resource for everyone concerned with CM: from CTOs and CIOs to development, QA, and project managers and software engineers to analysts, testers, and compliance professionals. Praise for Configuration Management Best Practices ""Understanding change is critical to any attempt to manage change. Bob Aiello and Leslie Sachs's Configuration Management Best Practices presents fundamental definitions and explanations to help practitioners understand change and its potential impact."" -Mary Lou A. Hines Fritts, CIO and Vice Provost Academic Programs, University of Missouri-Kansas City ""Few books on software configuration management emphasize the role of people and organizational context in defining and executing an effective SCM process. Bob Aiello and Leslie Sachs's book will give you the information you need not only to manage change effectively but also to manage the transition to a better SCM process."" -Steve Berczuk, Agile Software Developer, and author of Software Configuration Management Patterns: Effective Teamwork, Practical Integration ""Bob Aiello and Leslie Sachs succeed handsomely in producing an important book, at a practical and balanced level of detail, for this topic that often 'goes without saying' (and hence gets many projects into deep trouble). Their passion for the topic shows as they cover a wonderful range of topics-even culture, personality, and dealing with resistance to change-in an accessible form that can be applied to any project. The software industry has needed a book like this for a long time!"" -Jim Brosseau, Clarrus Consulting Group, and author of Software Teamwork: Taking Ownership for Success ""A must read for anyone developing or managing software or hardware projects. Bob Aiello and Leslie Sachs are able to bridge the language gap between the myriad of communities involved with successful Configuration Management implementations. They describe practical, real world practices that can be implemented by developers, managers, standard makers, and even Classical CM Folk."" -Bob Ventimiglia, Bobev Consulting ""A fresh and smart review of today's key concepts of SCM, build management, and related key practices on day-to-day software engineering. From the voice of an expert, Bob Aiello and Leslie Sachs offer an invaluable resource to success in SCM."" -Pablo Santos Luaces, CEO of Codice Software ""Bob Aiello and Leslie Sachs have a gift for stimulating the types of conversation and thought that necessarily precede needed organizational change.

"Constraining Football: A vision for player development","Bartlett, Ben; Barrow, Kevin; Coach Weekly, Soccer; Maric, Rene","Soccer Coach Weekly","2021-12-15","Paperback","127","","","English","9781912307012","","https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1912307014?tag=handylibita03-21&linkCode=osi&th=1&psc=1","","","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41NjRix+wkL._SL500_.jpg","This is a book about learning. Learning can often be forgotten or fringe in the pursuit of other fruits. When these fruits are practice books, formal & standardised education and easy to digest, saccharine infused niceties there is a risk that we overlook one of the fundamental human needs; to develop, change, grow and learn to master crafts. The mastery of crafts such as coaching takes time, earnest commitment and many challenging, chastening experiences that leave us feeling a little less than skilful. However we overcome these challenges, they are likely to be enablers that support our learning and growth towards becoming a better coach than we were yesterday. This book is intended to support that exploration; generate and guide your thinking whilst ensuring the gestation of those seeds of thought. We will encourage and enable a deeper understanding of the people or players in our care and provide some illumination on how to guide our decisions in designing environments that are responsive to both you and your players. There will be no coaching prescriptions, simply because the general nature of a constraints-led approach is at odds with prescription focussed approaches to coaching. A constraints-led approach encourages us to take account of, better understand and integrate what we understand about the player (person), the game of football (task) and the specific conditions on any given day (environment) into every interaction, coaching session, game-day, tournament and any other activity we might engage in within player development. There will, however, be some probing into alternative ways for coaches to eschew the traditional practice book or formal curriculum and scaffold player and coach development towards a unique, bespoke, responsive eco-system that keeps rhythm with the beating heart of our own football club. Taken together, this can support the experiences we are exposed to and build to be unique, individual and reflective of what collectively we have agreed and understand to be important in our world. The characteristics of our context should be coupled to our commitments. The backdrop to the way of thinking expressed in this book has been supported by a generation spent within coaching and development; fortune has favoured the opportunity for me to support in a sustained fashion the development of players who have been top scorers at The World Cup, multiple Premier League winners and coaches who coach and manage across some of Europe’s top leagues. However, these perceived successes must be allied to the players within those same development programmes whose opportunity has been curtailed by serious injury and coaches who have fallen foul of some of the vagaries that the industry can perpetuate. As such, no development system is universally successful or unsuccessful and we should be careful, thoughtful and willing to as readily ‘research’ the graveyard as we do the top table. That mirror may be unpleasant to stare into at times, yet it is an important reflection of our own fallibilities and an important reminder to ensure that whatever outcomes our coaching and development programmes facilitate; supporting them to be as humanly supportive yet challenging as is consciously achievable is a worthy and important goal. The aspiration for this book is that it provides a map of some of the landscape that coaches may wish to explore in developing their own constraints-led approach to development both for the players in their care and for themselves as a coach. Illuminating this fertile land sufficiently to support discoveries that are purposeful, personal and personable.","","23.0","Ball Games","4.12","09/18/2023","","","","","","","","Football"

The Brazilian FIFA Player of the Century grew up playing futsal before transitioning to the 11-a-side game. So did many others - from household-name superstars to semi-professionals to Sunday league players.

The benefits of futsal have recently entered the mainstream, with initiatives, facilities, and organisations being created, but there are still coaches who are wary of using the sport to develop footballers. In the ever-changing modern game of football, futsal can give players an advantage over others.

In Developing the Modern Footballer through Futsal, England futsal coach Michael Skubala, and Seth Burkett, detail the ways in which futsal can be used to develop the technical and tactical skills of players of all abilities.

Aimed at coaches of all levels and ages, Developing the Modern Footballer through Futsal is a concise and practical book that provides an easy-to-understand and comprehensive guide to the ways in which futsal can be used as a development tool for football. From defending and attacking to transitional play and goalkeeping, this book provides something for everyone and aims to get you up-and-running fast.

Over 50 detailed sessions are provided, with each one related to specific football scenarios and detailing how performance in these scenarios can be improved through futsal. From gegenpressing to innovative creative play under pressure, this book outlines how futsal can be used to develop a wide range of football-specific skills, giving your players the edge.

About The Authors. Michael Skubala is the England Futsal Manager. Before this, he was the Assistant Coach, a position he held for five years. Prior to this he captained the side, and holds the record number of playing appearances for England. In addition to this, Michael is the Head Coach to the England under-21 squad, Great Britain Universities, the International Futsal Academy and Loughborough University. He is currently coaching the FA Futsal Level One and Level Two awards, one of only two coaches qualified to do so. In football, Michael holds his UEFA A Licence and is Performance Manager of Loughborough University Football Club. Previously he has been assistant football coach of Great Britain Universities. Seth Burkett is the last Englishman to play professional football in Brazil. In Brazil he became aware of futsal, understanding how it was used to develop Brazilian footballers. Upon returning to England, he began to play the sport. Seth has an honours degree in Sports Science from Loughborough, as well as a Master's degree in English. His previous books include Hobby and The Boy in Brazil, declared by the Daily Mirror as 'a captivating tale of a lad who refused to give up on his dream'.","","12.99","Books Global Store","3.75","09/18/2023","","","","","","","","Football"

Practitioners have increasingly discovered that close attention to a software system’s architecture pays valuable dividends. Without an architecture that is appropriate for the problem being solved, a project will stumble along or, most likely, fail. Even with a superb architecture, if that architecture is not well understood or well communicated the project is unlikely to succeed.



Documenting Software Architectures, Second Edition, provides the most complete and current guidance, independent of language or notation, on how to capture an architecture in a commonly understandable form. Drawing on their extensive experience, the authors first help you decide what information to document, and then, with guidelines and examples (in various notations, including UML), show you how to express an architecture so that others can successfully build, use, and maintain a system from it. The book features rules for sound documentation, the goals and strategies of documentation, architectural views and styles, documentation for software interfaces and software behavior, and templates for capturing and organizing information to generate a coherent package. New and improved in this second edition:

Coverage of architectural styles such as service-oriented architectures, multi-tier architectures, and data models
Guidance for documentation in an Agile development environment
Deeper treatment of documentation of rationale, reflecting best industrial practices
Improved templates, reflecting years of use and feedback, and more documentation layout options
A new, comprehensive example (available online), featuring documentation of a Web-based service-oriented system
Reference guides for three important architecture documentation languages: UML, AADL, and SySML

“This new edition is brighter, shinier, more complete, more pragmatic, more focused than the previous one, and I wouldn’t have thought it possible to improve on the original. As the field of software architecture has grown over these past decades, there is much more to be said, much more that we know, and much more that we can reflect upon of what’s worked and what hasn’t—and the authors here do all that, and more.”

Finding out about someone by reading their correspondence is a fundamentally different thing than reading their biography. Letters offer both more intimacy with the subject and at the same time a crucial distance--the exact distance the letter-writer intended from the people to whom he was writing. In Perfectly Reasonable Deviations from the Beaten Track, Michelle Feynman collects her famous father's letters to reveal a warm, honest man with high expectations for himself, his loved ones, and the human race. Long before Richard Feynman won the Nobel Prize, he was a smart, skinny graduate student at Princeton, writing letters to his mother and relating the mundane details of college life. ""Dear Mom.... The raincoat came O.K. It is very nice,"" he writes. By the time he finished his Ph.D., Feynman had fallen for Arline Greenbaum, who had already been diagnosed with tuberculosis. Their tragically short marriage is set in letters against Feynman's first job--working on the atomic bomb project at Los Alamos, New Mexico. 

Even while working on top secret physics, Feynman was an enthusiastic correspondent, jumping eagerly at the chance to encourage a young scientist, correct a public misperception, or tell a goofy joke to his family. Self-effacing, charmingly down to earth, and occasionally cranky, these letters cover Feynman's entire career, although in the fits and starts one would expect from a collection such as this. His own words to students, spouses, daughters, and fellow scientists reveal Feynman's brilliance far more effectively than any biographical lens ever could. --Therese Littleton

Most people believe that the best way to motivate is with rewards like money—the carrot-and-stick approach. That's a mistake, says Daniel H. Pink (author of To Sell Is Human: The Surprising Truth About Motivating Others). In this provocative and persuasive new book, he asserts that the secret to high performance and satisfaction-at work, at school, and at home—is the deeply human need to direct our own lives, to learn and create new things, and to do better by ourselves and our world.

Drawing on four decades of scientific research on human motivation, Pink exposes the mismatch between what science knows and what business does—and how that affects every aspect of life. He examines the three elements of true motivation—autonomy, mastery, and purpose-and offers smart and surprising techniques for putting these into action in a unique book that will change how we think and transform how we live.","","10.9","Job Hunting","","08/15/2023","","","","","","","","IT related"

Whilst there are hundreds of books that look into the specific principles of coaches like Jurgen Klopp, Pep Guardiola, and Marcelo Bielsa, there is no core, distilled text on the key principles of the game.

Until now.

Join best-selling author and coach Peter Prickett as he puts football under the microscope and breaks it down into its constituent parts. By addressing the two primary phases in-possession and out-of-possession the book examines the five attacking and five defending principles, plus the transitions between each phase, to reveal the underlying heart of the beautiful game.

These principles have underpinned coach education for decades and largely been unchallenged. When examining them, other deeper values emerge to support the one true principle to score.

Designed for coaches and football fans interested in the theory of football, this handbook is a must-read for anyone looking to understand the foundations that football is built on.

Peter Prickett is an FA affiliate tutor with a decade of experience coaching with various organisations, and the author of the internationally best-selling books on ""Developing Skill: Guides to 3v3 Soccer Coaching"".

Dr. Lawrence Peters is an industry-recognized expert with decades of experience conducting research and leading real-world software projects. Beyond getting the best developers, equipment, budget, and timeline possible—Peters concludes that no factor is more critical to project success than the manager’s role. Drawing on proven practices from allied industries such as business, psychology, accounting, and law, he describes a broader project-management methodology—with principles that software managers can readily adapt to help increase their own effectiveness and the productivity of their teams. Unlike other books on the topic, this book focuses squarely on the manager—and shows how to get results without adopting philosophies from Genghis Khan or Machiavelli. (There is mention of Godzilla, however.) Packed with real-world examples and pragmatic advice, this book shows any software development manager—new or experienced—how to lead teams in delivering the right results for their business.","","6.86","Books Global Store","3.53","08/15/2023","","","","","","","","IT related"

For any task you might want to do, there's a right way, a wrong way, and a way so monumentally bad that no one would ever try it. How To is a guide to the third kind of approach. It's full of highly impractical advice for everything from landing a plane to digging a hole.

Bestselling author and cartoonist Randall Munroe explains how to predict the weather by analyzing the pixels of your Facebook photos. He teaches you how to tell if you're a baby boomer or a millennial by measuring the radioactivity of your teeth. He offers tips for taking a selfie with a telescope, crossing a river by boiling it, and getting to your appointments on time by destroying the moon. And if you want to get rid of this book once you're done with it, he walks you through your options for proper disposal, including dissolving it in the ocean, converting it to a vapour, using tectonic plates to subduct it into the Earth's mantle, or launching it into the sun.

By exploring the most complicated ways to do simple tasks, Munroe doesn't just make things difficult for himself and his readers. As he did so brilliantly in What If?, he invites us to explore the most absurd reaches of the possible. Full of clever infographics and amusing illustrations, How To is a delightfully mind-bending way to better understand the science and technology underlying the things we do every day.

'Wonderful ... superb' Daily Mail

What makes a bridge wobble when it's not meant to? Billions of dollars mysteriously vanish into thin air? A building rock when its resonant frequency matches a gym class leaping to Snap's 1990 hit I've Got The Power? The answer is maths. Or, to be precise, what happens when maths goes wrong in the real world.

As Matt Parker shows us, our modern lives are built on maths: computer programmes, finance, engineering. And most of the time this maths works quietly behind the scenes, until ... it doesn't. Exploring and explaining a litany of glitches, near-misses and mishaps involving the internet, big data, elections, street signs, lotteries, the Roman empire and a hapless Olympic shooting team, Matt Parker shows us the bizarre ways maths trips us up, and what this reveals about its essential place in our world.

Mathematics doesn't have good 'people skills', but we would all be better off, he argues, if we saw it as a practical ally. This book shows how, by making maths our friend, we can learn from its pitfalls. It also contains puzzles, challenges, geometric socks, jokes about binary code and three deliberate mistakes. Getting it wrong has never been more fun.","","7.69","Books Global Store","4.11","09/18/2023","","","","","","","","Science"

No longer is it sufficient simply to check on an organisation's quality management system: the revision demands that auditors assess the leadership and management of the quality system. This brings the standard alongside the widely proven system and process approach to continuing quality transformation that lies at the heart of the very best global companies.
Over a million registered organisations around the world need to engage with the revised requirements. If you work for one of them the changes may be significant. In Implementing ISO 9001:2015 business transformation experts Jan Gillett, Paul Simpson and Susannah Clarke take managers step-by-step through the process needed for successful transition, improving results and facilitating a smooth audit. By applying the principles and methodologies, and using the book's templates and questions with their teams and suppliers, managers will transform the performance of their organisations. The tangible benefits will pay for the transition many times over.
Implementing ISO 9001:2015 is a comprehensive guide to making the necessary transition to the new standard. The changes can also be used to stimulate transformation in organisations and their wider environments, coordinating processes to achieve both customer satisfaction and reduced operating costs.

Its purpose is to help students develop, in a short time, a basic competence in each of the many areas of mathematics needed in advanced courses in physics, chemistry, and engineering. Students are given sufficient depth to gain a solid foundation (this is not a recipe book). At the same time, they are not overwhelmed with detailed proofs that are more appropriate for students of mathematics. The emphasis is on mathematical methods rather than applications, but students are given some idea of how the methods will be used along with some simple applications.","","","Physics","4.20","09/18/2023","","","","","","","","Science"

With a blend of software engineering facts and thought-provoking opinions, Fred Brooks offers insight for anyone managing complex projects. These essays draw from his experience as project manager for the IBM System/360 computer family and then for OS/360, its massive software system. Now, 45 years after the initial publication of his book, Brooks has revisited his original ideas and added new thoughts and advice, both for readers already familiar with his work and for readers discovering it for the first time.

The added chapters contain (1) a crisp condensation of all the propositions asserted in the original book, including Brooks' central argument in The Mythical Man-Month: that large programming projects suffer management problems different from small ones due to the division of labor; that the conceptual integrity of the product is therefore critical; and that it is difficult but possible to achieve this unity; (2) Brooks' view of these propositions a generation later; (3) a reprint of his classic 1986 paper ""No Silver Bullet""; and (4) today's thoughts on the 1986 assertion, ""There will be no silver bullet within ten years.""

What you need to learn to pass a Cisco certification exam such as CCNA and what you need to know to survive in the real world are two very different things. The strategies that this book offers weren 't on the exam, but they 're exactly what you need to do your job well. Network Warrior takes you step by step through the world of hubs, switches, firewalls, and more, including ways to troubleshoot a congested network, and when to upgrade and why. Along the way, you 'll gain an historical perspective of various networking features, such as the way Ethernet evolved. Based on the author 's own experience as well as those he worked for and with, Network Warrior is a Cisco-centric book, focused primarily on the TCP/IP protocol and Ethernet networks -- the realm that Cisco Systems now dominates. The book covers: The type of networks now in use, from LANs, WANs and MANs to CANs The OSI Model and the layers involved in sending data Hubs, repeaters, switches, and trunks in practice Auto negotiation and why it 's a common problem in network slowdowns Route maps, routing protocols, and switching algorithms in Cisco routers The resilient Ethernet -- how to make things truly redundant Cisco 6500 multi-layer switches and the Catalyst 3750 switch Telecom nomenclature -- why it 's different from the data world T1 and DS3 Firewall theory, designing access lists, authentication in Cisco devices Server load balancing technology Content switch module in action Designing QOS and what QOS does not do IP design and subnetting made easy The book also explains how to sell your ideas to management, how networks become a mess as a company grows, and why change control is your friend.

- Steve McConnell, author, Code Complete

When programmers list their favorite books, Jon Bentley's collection of programming pearls is commonly included among the classics. Just as natural pearls grow from grains of sand that irritate oysters, programming pearls have grown from real problems that have irritated real programmers. With origins beyond solid engineering, in the realm of insight and creativity, Bentley's pearls offer unique and clever solutions to those nagging problems. Illustrated by programs designed as much for fun as for instruction, the book is filled with lucid and witty descriptions of practical programming techniques and fundamental design principles. It is not at all surprising that Programming Pearls has been so highly valued by programmers at every level of experience. 

In this revision, the first in 14 years, Bentley has substantially updated his essays to reflect current programming methods and environments. In addition, there are three new essays on (1) testing, debugging, and timing; (2) set representations; and (3) string problems. All the original programs have been rewritten, and an equal amount of new code has been generated. Implementations of all the programs, in C or C++, are now available on the Web.

What remains the same in this new edition is Bentley's focus on the hard core of programming problems and his delivery of workable solutions to those problems. Whether you are new to Bentley's classic or are revisiting his work for some fresh insight, this book is sure to make your own list of favorites.","","","Programming","4.20","08/15/2023","","","","","","","","IT related"

First he taught you classical mechanics. Now, physicist Leonard Susskind has teamed up with data engineer Art Friedman to present the theory and associated mathematics of the strange world of quantum mechanics.

In this follow-up to The Theoretical Minimum, Susskind and Friedman provide a lively introduction to this famously difficult field, which attempts to understand the behavior of sub-atomic objects through mathematical abstractions. Unlike other popularizations that shy away from quantum mechanics’ weirdness, Quantum Mechanics embraces the utter strangeness of quantum logic. The authors offer crystal-clear explanations of the principles of quantum states, uncertainty and time dependence, entanglement, and particle and wave states, among other topics, and each chapter includes exercises to ensure mastery of each area. Like The Theoretical Minimum, this volume runs parallel to Susskind’s eponymous Stanford University-hosted continuing education course.

An approachable yet rigorous introduction to a famously difficult topic, Quantum Mechanics provides a tool kit for amateur scientists to learn physics at their own pace.

Because, when you are a leader, being a good speaker isn't enough. You have to be a great speaker. Your reputation and the success of your business depend on being able to speak to a variety of audiences confidently and persuasively. Through contemporary and historical examples, Chris provides practical advice on how his readers can take their game to another level by understanding ideas such as: * You are the message - it's your experience, vision and character that audiences want * As a leader, you have only three speeches: to identify, to influence and to inspire * Speak less to say more.

Scientist Carlo Rovelli has spent his whole life exploring these questions and pushing the boundaries of what we know. In this mind-expanding book, he shows how our understanding of reality has changed throughout centuries, from Democritus to loop quantum gravity. Taking us on a wondrous journey, he invites us to imagine a whole new world where black holes are waiting to explode, spacetime is made up of grains, and infinity does not exist -- a vast universe still largely undiscovered.

But being a great ScrumMaster, one who truly embodies the principles of servant-leadership and helps move a team to the high performance levels possible with Scrum, is much harder and much more elusive. In his over ten years of coaching numerous Scrum teams, the highly-respected and experienced Scrum coach Geoff Watts has identified patterns that separate a good ScrumMaster from a great one. In this book, he not only illustrates these patterns through stories of his own experiences and those of the many Scrum teams he has encountered but offers practical guidance for you on your own path to greatness.

In this book you will learn:
The skills and characteristics of great ScrumMasters
How to generate, maintain and increase engagement from the team
How to increase the effectiveness of the Scrum meetings, such as retrospectives and daily scrums.
How to foster a more creative and collaborative team
How to increase the performance of the team
How to know when you are a successful ScrumMaster\

Scrum Mastery is for practicing ScrumMasters who want to develop themselves into a great servant-leader capable of taking their teams beyond simple process compliance.

Comments on the book

Mike Cohn, in his foreword for the book, said:

""Most books rehash well-trod territory and I don’t finish them any wiser. I am positive I will be referring back to this book for many years"" 

Roman Pichler, author of Agile Product Management with Scrum: Creating Products That Customers Love said:

""I am thoroughly impressed with how comprehensive and well-written the book is. It will be indispensable for many people""

Jean Tabaka, Agile Fellow, Rally Software:

""Geoff brings us a personal and inspired peak into what truly moves us from good to great: great in how we serve; great in how we lead; great in how we create mastery in our teams and organizations; and, great in how we recognize the impediments to our own growth to greatness. Scrum mastery is a skill that can be honed and Geoff gives us rich tools to sharpen our craft.""","","10.48","Change Management","4.23","08/15/2023","","","","","","","","IT related"

But what if your “efficient” company—the one with the reduced headcount and the “stretch” goals—is actually slowing down and losing money? What if your employees are burning out doing the work of two or more people, leaving them no time for planning, prioritizing, or even lunch? What if you’re losing employees faster than you can hire them? What if your superefficient company is suddenly falling behind? Tom DeMarco, a leading management consultant to both Fortune 500 and up-and-coming companies, has discovered a counterintuitive principle that explains why efficiency improvement can sometimes make a company slow. If your real organizational goal is to become fast (responsive and agile), then he proposes that what you need is not more efficiency, but more slack. What is “slack”? Slack is the degree of freedom in a company that allows it to change. It could be something as simple as adding an assistant to a department, letting high-priced talent spend less time at the photo copier and more time making key decisions. Slack could also appear in the way a company treats employees: instead of loading them up with overwork, a company designed with slack allows its people room to breathe, increase effectiveness, and reinvent themselves. In thirty—three short chapters filled with creative learning tools and charts, you and your company can learn how to: ∑make sense of the Efficiency/Flexibility quandary ∑run directly toward risk instead of away from it ∑strengthen the creative role of middle management ∑make change and growth work together for even greater profits A innovative approach that works for new- and old-economy companies alike, this revolutionary handbook will debunk commonly held assumptions about real-world management, and give you and your company a brand-new model for achieving and maintaining true effectiveness—and a healthier bottom line.","","21.36","Books Global Store","4.03","08/15/2023","","","","","","","","IT related"

Distinct from the details of implementation, algorithm, and data representation, an architecture holds the key to achieving system quality, is a reusable asset that can be applied to subsequent systems, and is crucial to a software organization's business strategy.

Drawing on their own extensive experience, the authors cover the essential technical topics for designing, specifying, and validating a system.

Distinct from the details of implementation, algorithm, and data representation, an architecture holds the key to achieving system quality, is a reusable asset that can be applied to subsequent systems, and is crucial to a software organization's business strategy.

Drawing on their own extensive experience, the authors cover the essential technical topics for designing, specifying, and validating a system. They also emphasize the importance of the business context in which large systems are designed. Their aim is to present software architecture in a real-world setting, reflecting both the opportunities and constraints that companies encounter.

These are the difficult problems architects face, what this book's authors call the hard parts. These topics have no best practices, forcing architects to understand various tradeoffs to succeed. This book discusses these hard parts by not only investigating what makes architecture so difficult, but also by providing proven ways to address these problems and make them easier.

The book explores topics such as choosing an appropriate architecture, deciding on service granularity, managing workflows and orchestration, managing and decoupling contracts, managing distributed transactions, and optimizing operational characteristics such as scalability, elasticity, and performance. As practicing consultants, the authors focus on questions they commonly hear architects ask and provide techniques that enable them to discover the tradeoffs necessary to answer these questions.","","50.49","Books Global Store","4.33","08/15/2023","","","","","","","","IT related"

Not only did Scolari read the book and apply its strategies, but on some occasions he actually slipped copies of the text underneath his players' doors during the night. Commenting on his use of The Art of War after the World Cup win, Scolari confirmed ""sometimes a different approach like this can help."" Quite the understatement.Composed in the late 5th century BCE, The Art of War by Chinese general Sun Tzu is the most well-known and well-respected work on military strategy and philosophy in history. Proving its timeless brilliance, the now 2400-year-old text is still used in teaching strategy and philosophy at the leading military academies today. The Art of War is used as instructional material at the US Military Academy at West Point and it is also recommended reading for Royal Officer cadets at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst. Business Insider magazine names The Art of War as one of the top 25 most influential books ever written, and highly respected astrophysicist and social commentator Neil deGrasse Tyson identifies Sun Tzu's work as one of the ""seven books every intelligent person on the planet should read."" The Art of War and Sun Tzu have been referenced and quoted in various movies and television shows, including ""Wall Street,"" ""The Rock,"" ""The Family Man"" ""Bandits,"" and the James Bond movie ""Die Another Day"". In television, The Art of War has been referenced countless times, including in two of the most popular and most critically acclaimed shows of all time: ""The Sopranos"" (season 3, episode 9) and ""Breaking Bad (season 2, episode 7). Most significantly for this project, The Art of War has been applied in sports, and not just by Scolari. NFL coach Bill Belichick, the coach with the most Super Bowl victories of all time, has stated on multiple occasions his admiration for The Art of War, with one specific headline reading ""Belichick explains how advice from Sun Tzu's 'The Art of War' helped build the Patriots dynasty.""

SysML Distilled is the first clear, concise guide for everyone who wants to start creating effective SysML models.

(Drawing on his pioneering experience at Lockheed Martin and NASA, Lenny Delligatti illuminates SysML's core components and provides practical advice to help you create good models and good designs. Delligatti begins with an easy-to-understand overview of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and an explanation of how SysML enables effective system specification, analysis, design, optimization, verification, and validation. Next, he shows how to use all nine types of SysML diagrams, even if you have no previous experience with modeling languages. A case study running through the text demonstrates the use of SysML in modeling a complex, real-world sociotechnical system.

Modeled after Martin Fowler's classic UML Distilled, Delligatti's indispensable guide quickly teaches you what you need to know to get started and helps you deepen your knowledge incrementally as the need arises. Like SysML itself, the book is method independent and is designed to support whatever processes, procedures, and tools you already use.

Coverage Includes 
Why SysML was created and the business case for using it Quickly putting SysML to practical use What to know before you start a SysML modeling project Essential concepts that apply to all SysML diagrams SysML diagram elements and relationships Diagramming block definitions, internal structures, use cases, activities, interactions, state machines, constraints, requirements, and packages Using allocations to define mappings among elements across a model SysML notation tables, version changes, and sources for more information

He was a great teacher, a born showman, bongo drummer, buffoon & iconoclast; a scientific magician capable of transcendental leaps of the imagination. During his career he was drawn into research on the atomic bomb before working out his path-integral formulation of quantum mechanics & quantum electro-dynamics. Subsequently he developed the diagrammatic technique, as a result of which Feynman diagrams became ubiquitous in quantum field theory, elementary particle physics & statistical mechanics. From 1950 he was based at the California Institute of Technology, where he worked on the superfluidity of liquid helium, the theory of polarons, the theory of weak interactions, the quantum theory of gravitation, partons, quark jets & the limits of computation. He'd a unified view of physics & nature. He took the whole of nature as the arena of his science & imagination. Jagdish Mehra personally knew Feynman for 30 years. In 1980 Feynman suggested he might do what he had already done for Heisenberg, Pauli & Dirac, that is write a definitive account of his life, science & personality. Mehra instantly agreed & subsequently spent several weeks talking to him. After Feynman's death Mehra interviewed almost 80 people who'd known him & aspects of his work. This book draws on this unique material & on Feynman's remarkable writings. It covers his childhood, his three marriages, his extraordinary range of interests. But most important, it deals with his scientific work in far greater detail than in any other biographical work. What has emerged is an authoritative account of Feynman's life & achievements.","","14.45","Books Global Store","4.17","09/18/2023","","","","","","","","Biographies"

It is the definitive reference guide, now in a second edition. Although the first edition was written in 1978, it continues to be a worldwide best-seller. This second edition brings the classic original up to date to include the ANSI standard. 

From the Preface: 
We have tried to retain the brevity of the first edition. C is not a big language, and it is not well served by a big book. We have improved the exposition of critical features, such as pointers, that are central to C programming. We have refined the original examples, and have added new examples in several chapters. For instance, the treatment of complicated declarations is augmented by programs that convert declarations into words and vice versa. As before, all examples have been tested directly from the text, which is in machine-readable form. 

As we said in the first preface to the first edition, C ""wears well as one's experience with it grows."" With a decade more experience, we still feel that way. We hope that this book will help you to learn C and use it well.

What happened to the Sun's neutrinos to make them disappear on their way to the Earth? Why does the fact that the sky is dark at night prove that our universe is changing and hasn't always been the way it is? What are the chances that, if ever we make contact with intelligent beings who evolved under conditions similar to those on Earth, they too will be upright, bipedal with two arms ending in five-fingered hands, with a head on top containing a pair of eyes, a nose, and a mouth? 

Questions like these are posed - and often answered - in this delightful excursion through the Universe with John Gribbin, the noted award-winning astronomer and science writer. Here he explores the topics of his passionate expertise - often some of the more outlandish aspects of astronomy frequently shunned in the sober pages of scientific journals - including supernova explosions. neutron stars, white holes, black holes, wormholes, and inflation.

Like a Wu Li Master who would teach us wonder for the falling petal before speaking of gravity, Zukav writes in beautifully clear language—with no mathematical equations—opening our minds to the exciting new theories that are beginning to embrace the ultimate nature of our universe...Quantum mechanics, relativity, and beyond to the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen effect and Bell's theorem.

At an Esalen Institute meeting in 1976, tai chi master Al Huang said that the Chinese word for physics is Wu Li, ""patterns of organic energy."" Journalist Gary Zukav and the others present developed the idea of physics as the dance of the Wu Li Masters--the teachers of physical essence. Zukav explains the concept further: The Wu Li Master dances with his student. The Wu Li Master does not teach, but the student learns. The Wu Li Master always begins at the center, the heart of the matter.... This book deals not with knowledge, which is always past tense anyway, but with imagination, which is physics come alive, which is Wu Li.... Most people believe that physicists are explaining the world. Some physicists even believe that, but the Wu Li Masters know that they are only dancing with it. The ""new physics"" of Zukav's 1979 book comprises quantum theory, particle physics, and relativity. Even as these theories age they haven't percolated all that far into the collective consciousness; they're too far removed from mundane human experience not to need introduction. The Dancing Wu Li Masters remains an engaging, accessible way to meet the most profound and mind-altering insights of 20th-century science. --Mary Ellen Curtin","","17.43","Books Global Store","4.00","09/18/2023","","","","","","","","Science"

Today, physicists and mathematicians throughout the world are feverishly working on one of the most ambitious theories ever proposed: superstring theory. String theory, as it is often called, is the key to the Unified Field Theory that eluded Einstein for more than thirty years. Finally, the century-old antagonism between the large and the small--General Relativity and Quantum Theory--is resolved. String theory proclaims that all of the wondrous happenings in the universe, from the frantic dancing of subatomic quarks to the majestic swirling of heavenly galaxies, are reflections of one grand physical principle and manifestations of one single entity: microscopically tiny vibrating loops of energy, a billionth of a billionth the size of an atom. In this brilliantly articulated and refreshingly clear book, Greene relates the scientific story and the human struggle behind twentieth-century physics' search for a theory of everything.

Through the masterful use of metaphor and analogy, The Elegant Universe makes some of the most sophisticated concepts ever contemplated viscerally accessible and thoroughly entertaining, bringing us closer than ever to understanding how the universe works.","","11.41","Books Global Store","4.09","09/18/2023","","","","","","","","Science"

Space and time form the very fabric of the cosmos. Yet they remain among the most mysterious of concepts. Is space an entity? Why does time have a direction? Could the universe exist without space and time? Can we travel to the past? Greene has set himself a daunting task: to explain non-intuitive, mathematical concepts like String Theory, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, and Inflationary Cosmology with analogies drawn from common experience. From Newton’s unchanging realm in which space and time are absolute, to Einstein’s fluid conception of spacetime, to quantum mechanics’ entangled arena where vastly distant objects can instantaneously coordinate their behavior, Greene takes us all, regardless of our scientific backgrounds, on an irresistible and revelatory journey to the new layers of reality that modern physics has discovered lying just beneath the surface of our everyday world.","","13.19","Kellogg's","4.12","09/18/2023","","","","","","","","Science"

Objects also form the basis for many web technologies such as JavaScript, Python, and PHP. It is of vital importance to learn the fundamental concepts of object orientation before starting to use object-oriented development environments. OOP promotes good design practices, code portability, and reuse–but it requires a shift in thinking to be fully understood. Programmers new to OOP should resist the temptation to jump directly into a particular programming language (such as Objective-C, VB .NET, C++, C# .NET, or Java) or a modeling language (such as UML), and instead first take the time to learn what author Matt Weisfeld calls “the object-oriented thought process.” Written by a developer for developers who want to make the leap to object-oriented technologies, The Object-Oriented Thought Process provides a solutions-oriented approach to object-oriented programming. Readers will learn to understand the proper uses of inheritance and composition, the difference between aggregation and association, and the important distinction between interfaces and implementations. While programming technologies have been changing and evolving over the years, object-oriented concepts remain a constant–no matter what the platform. This revised edition focuses on interoperability across programming technologies, whether you are using objects in traditional application design, in XML-based data transactions, in web page development, in mobile apps, or in any modern programming environment. “Programmers who aim to create high quality software–as all programmers should–must learn the varied subtleties of the familiar yet not so familiar beasts called objects and classes. Doing so entails careful study of books such as Matt Weisfeld’s The Object-Oriented Thought Process.” –Bill McCarty, author of Java Distributed Objects, and Object-Oriented Design in Java Contents at a Glance 1 Introduction to Object-Oriented Concepts 2 How to Think in Terms of Objects 3 Advanced Object-Oriented Concepts 4 The Anatomy of a Class 5 Class Design Guidelines 6 Designing with Objects 7 Mastering Inheritance and Composition 8 Frameworks and Reuse: Designing with Interfaces and Abstract Classes 9 Building Objects and Object-Oriented Design 10 Creating Object Models 11 Objects and Portable Data: XML and JSON 12 Persistent Objects: Serialization, Marshaling, and Relational Databases 13 Objects in Web Services, Mobile Apps, and Hybrids 14 Objects and Client/Server Applications 15 Design Patterns","","35.62","Books Global Store","3.73","08/15/2023","","","","","","","","IT related"

Yet The Origin of Species (1859) is also a humane and inspirational vision of ecological interrelatedness, revealing the complex mutual interdependencies between animal and plant life, climate and physical environment, and—by implication—within the human world.

Michael Frayn

The Strangest Man is the Costa Biography Award-winning account of Paul Dirac, the famous physicist sometimes called the British Einstein. He was one of the leading pioneers of the greatest revolution in twentieth-century science: quantum mechanics. The youngest theoretician ever to win the Nobel Prize for Physics, he was also pathologically reticent, strangely literal-minded and legendarily unable to communicate or empathize. Through his greatest period of productivity, his postcards home contained only remarks about the weather.

Based on a previously undiscovered archive of family papers, Graham Farmelo celebrates Dirac's massive scientific achievement while drawing a compassionate portrait of his life and work. Farmelo shows a man who, while hopelessly socially inept, could manage to love and sustain close friendship.

The Strangest Man is an extraordinary and moving human story, as well as a study of one of the most exciting times in scientific history.

A world-class physicist and a citizen scientist combine forces to teach Physics 101—the DIY way

The Theoretical Minimum is a book for anyone who has ever regretted not taking physics in college—or who simply wants to know how to think like a physicist. In this unconventional introduction, physicist Leonard Susskind and hacker-scientist George Hrabovsky offer a first course in physics and associated math for the ardent amateur. Unlike most popular physics books—which give readers a taste of what physicists know but shy away from equations or math—Susskind and Hrabovsky actually teach the skills you need to do physics, beginning with classical mechanics, yourself. Based on Susskind's enormously popular Stanford University-based (and YouTube-featured) continuing-education course, the authors cover the minimum—the theoretical minimum of the title—that readers need to master to study more advanced topics.

An alternative to the conventional go-to-college method, The Theoretical Minimum provides a tool kit for amateur scientists to learn physics at their own pace.

"Waltzing with Bears: Managing Risk on Software Projects","DeMarco, Tom; Lister, Timothy","Dorset House Publishing Co Inc.,U.S.","2003-03-01","Paperback","196","","","English","9780932633606","","https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0932633609?tag=handylibita03-21&linkCode=osi&th=1&psc=1","","","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51GNTIfFlVL._SL500_.jpg","An introduction to Lean thinking Lean is a mindset rather than a methodology; it is a way of thinking based on practices, strategies, tools and methods that can be applied to maximise value and minimise waste while ensuring that processes achieve corporate goals. Lean helps organisations in all sectors achieve their objectives by facilitating a long-term culture shift focusing on three fundamental areas: waste , customer value and continuous incremental improvement. A good assurance review will ensure that resources are being applied efficiently and effectively to achieve these objectives. Product overview Fundamentals of Assurance for Lean Projects explains the fundamental concepts of Lean and how they can be applied to any project, including software development and organisational change. It explains the jargon and dispels the mystique that surrounds Lean, providing readers with guidance and tips on performing audits or assurance reviews for Lean projects. It also describes how Lean fits with Agile and Kanban, and how it can be combined with Six Sigma to create an efficient, high-quality approach. The book provides strong practical guidance for those tasked with providing assurance for Lean projects. Read this book to learn about the approach and principles of Lean, the governance of Lean projects, and Lean audit and review. Topics covered include: The five main Lean principles and their significance.Tools used for root-cause analysis (the five whys and fishbone analysis).Defining and modelling customer value, and innovative responses to customer needs (the Kano model).Common causes of waste and how to improve flow.Customer pull and Kanban mechanisms to manage the associated flow of processing and information.The pursuit of perfection (Kaikaku and Kaizen) and total quality management (TQM).The application of Lean principles to software development.Practical suggestions for approaches to auditing. As with all books in the Fundamentals Series, Fundamentals of Assurance for Lean Projects introduces the subject and includes references for those who would like to further investigate specific areas.","","7.95","Books Global Store","3.97","08/15/2023","","","","","","","","IT related"

It now has 600,000 to a million page hits daily. Every now and then, Munroe would get emails asking him to arbitrate a science debate. 'My friend and I were arguing about what would happen if a bullet got struck by lightning, and we agreed that you should resolve it . . . ' He liked these questions so much that he started up What If. 

If your cells suddenly lost the power to divide, how long would you survive?

How dangerous is it, really, to be in a swimming pool in a thunderstorm?

If we hooked turbines to people exercising in gyms, how much power could we produce?

What if everyone only had one soulmate?

When (if ever) did the sun go down on the British empire? 

How fast can you hit a speed bump while driving and live?

What would happen if the moon went away?

In pursuit of answers, Munroe runs computer simulations, pores over stacks of declassified military research memos, solves differential equations, and consults with nuclear reactor operators. His responses are masterpieces of clarity and hilarity, studded with memorable cartoons and infographics.

Is the universe infinite?

Do we know what happened before the Big Bang?

Where is human consciousness located in the brain?

And are there more undiscovered particles out there, beyond the Higgs boson?

In the modern world, science is king: weekly headlines proclaim the latest scientific breakthroughs and numerous mathematical problems, once indecipherable, have now been solved. But are there limits to what we can discover about our physical universe?

In this very personal journey to the edges of knowledge, Marcus du Sautoy investigates how leading experts in fields from quantum physics and cosmology, to sensory perception and neuroscience, have articulated the current lie of the land. In doing so, he travels to the very boundaries of understanding, questioning contradictory stories and consulting cutting edge data.

Is it possible that we will one day know everything? Or are there fields of research that will always lie beyond the bounds of human comprehension? And if so, how do we cope with living in a universe where there are things that will forever transcend our understanding?

In What We Cannot Know, Marcus du Sautoy leads us on a thought-provoking expedition to the furthest reaches of modern science. Prepare to be taken to the edge of knowledge to find out if there’s anything we truly cannot know.
