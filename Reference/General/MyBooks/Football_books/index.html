<p><em>Summary:</em> Successful footballers are typically those who are best able to regulate their emotions, fix their attention, utilise effective interpersonal skills, and remain highly motivated and self-assured in the face of consistent challenges. These behaviours are the hallmark of mentally tough, emotionally intelligent players, and can be grouped under the 5Cs of: Commitment, Communication, Concentration, Control, and Confidence. The 5Cs, however, are rarely innate - they are a product of a player's long-term psycho-social development and, crucially, they can be coached and nurtured. The aim of the 5Cs program, in this book, is to show coaches how to develop these important psycho-social skills and help young players to understand how they can truly achieve their potential. Written specifically for soccer coaches of all levels, Coaching Psychological Skills in Youth Football details each C in a methodical and practical manner with real-world exercises for training and matches. The book is relevant to soccer coaches working with 5-16 year-old players, with individual techniques and practices marked for appropriate age groups. By weaving these techniques into their normal coaching practice, coaches will help educate young players to optimise their motivation, discipline, composure, self-belief and teamwork. A complete 12 month development plan is included alongside a case study from a youth coach who has actually experienced the 5C journey. Coaching Psychological Skills in Youth Football will build your confidence as a coach as you learn how to grow and apply a world-class knowledge of sport psychology in youth football.</p>

It will question your thoughts and help you learn and develop as a coach. If you are a parent taking up the reigns of a new team or a Level 1 coach this book is for you. As you read through you will understand more about what coaching your players really is and means. It is the first book you should read and the one book you should keep by your side. It is written to help you and all grassroots coaches to coach. Richard Seedhouse is an FA tutor holding the UEFA B (Level3) Coaching Licence and the Level 2 goalkeeping Coaching Certificate. He is an FA Centre of Excellence coach with Coventry City Ladies and has coached the youth team at Nuneaton Borough FC. Richard maintains his grassroots links as the Football Development Officer at Coundon Court FC, recent winners of the FA Charter Standard Development Club of the Year award for the Midlands Region. Testimonies "The prompting of questions and challenging the coach to design progressions and sessions will fit in with current work around coach development and education" Andy Poole, UEFA A Licence coach and the FA Regional Coach Development Manager, talking about how the book can help Trevor Brooking and the FA's new initiative on coach development. "Whenever we take on any new Level 1 coach at our sports centre I will make sure they know about this book and recommend they read it" Terry Harvey, UEFA B coach and Sports Centre Manager. "I have read many coaching manuals which show how to set up, organise and the key points to look for. However, this book shows what the coach can do to improve or improvise the sessions. Excellent for coaches just starting out on their coaching career" David Busst, UEFA A Licence coach, Coventry City FC Football Coaching in the Community Manager. "Easy to read and with a logical approach this book will give the coach the confidence to get involved with their players and actually begin to coach them" Michelle Hickmott, Level 2 Coach and England Ladies International at U21 and U23 and Birmingham City Ladies FC in the Premier League.

<p><em>Summary:</em> This is a book about learning. Learning can often be forgotten or fringe in the pursuit of other fruits. When these fruits are practice books, formal &amp; standardised education and easy to digest, saccharine infused niceties there is a risk that we overlook one of the fundamental human needs; to develop, change, grow and learn to master crafts. The mastery of crafts such as coaching takes time, earnest commitment and many challenging, chastening experiences that leave us feeling a little less than skilful. However we overcome these challenges, they are likely to be enablers that support our learning and growth towards becoming a better coach than we were yesterday. This book is intended to support that exploration; generate and guide your thinking whilst ensuring the gestation of those seeds of thought. We will encourage and enable a deeper understanding of the people or players in our care and provide some illumination on how to guide our decisions in designing environments that are responsive to both you and your players. There will be no coaching prescriptions, simply because the general nature of a constraints-led approach is at odds with prescription focussed approaches to coaching. A constraints-led approach encourages us to take account of, better understand and integrate what we understand about the player (person), the game of football (task) and the specific conditions on any given day (environment) into every interaction, coaching session, game-day, tournament and any other activity we might engage in within player development. There will, however, be some probing into alternative ways for coaches to eschew the traditional practice book or formal curriculum and scaffold player and coach development towards a unique, bespoke, responsive eco-system that keeps rhythm with the beating heart of our own football club. Taken together, this can support the experiences we are exposed to and build to be unique, individual and reflective of what collectively we have agreed and understand to be important in our world. The characteristics of our context should be coupled to our commitments. The backdrop to the way of thinking expressed in this book has been supported by a generation spent within coaching and development; fortune has favoured the opportunity for me to support in a sustained fashion the development of players who have been top scorers at The World Cup, multiple Premier League winners and coaches who coach and manage across some of Europe’s top leagues. However, these perceived successes must be allied to the players within those same development programmes whose opportunity has been curtailed by serious injury and coaches who have fallen foul of some of the vagaries that the industry can perpetuate. As such, no development system is universally successful or unsuccessful and we should be careful, thoughtful and willing to as readily ‘research’ the graveyard as we do the top table. That mirror may be unpleasant to stare into at times, yet it is an important reflection of our own fallibilities and an important reminder to ensure that whatever outcomes our coaching and development programmes facilitate; supporting them to be as humanly supportive yet challenging as is consciously achievable is a worthy and important goal. The aspiration for this book is that it provides a map of some of the landscape that coaches may wish to explore in developing their own constraints-led approach to development both for the players in their care and for themselves as a coach. Illuminating this fertile land sufficiently to support discoveries that are purposeful, personal and personable.</p>

<p><em>Summary:</em> Deliberate Soccer 50 Rondo and Positional Play Practices is the fifth title in the bestselling practice series by coach and author Ray Power. Rondos are a football training methodology in constrained spaces, where one team has an overload over another and attempts to keep the ball away from the opposition. It is a practical training approach that has been championed by legendary coaches Johan Cruyff and Pep Guardiola, and clubs like Ajax and Barcelona, amongst others. To these coaches and clubs, rondos are not just fun warm-up exercises, they are fundamental to the development of players and teams. This book contains 50 well-planned, thought-out, and presented rondo-based football training practices for soccer coaches. They take the coach on a journey through the training methodology from basic to complex, with an eye on pitch shapes, the number of players available, and different scoring systems. Whether you employ the rondo methodology with your players already, or are looking to increase your practical knowledge and use of this world-leading training approach, Deliberate Soccer 50 Rondo and Positional Play Practices will help grow and develop your coaching and your football teams.</p>

<p><em>Summary:</em> For Pele, futsal was "very important, no doubt." The Brazilian FIFA Player of the Century grew up playing futsal before transitioning to the 11-a-side game. So did many others - from household-name superstars to semi-professionals to Sunday league players.</p>
<p>The benefits of futsal have recently entered the mainstream, with initiatives, facilities, and organisations being created, but there are still coaches who are wary of using the sport to develop footballers. In the ever-changing modern game of football, futsal can give players an advantage over others.</p>
<p>In Developing the Modern Footballer through Futsal, England futsal coach Michael Skubala, and Seth Burkett, detail the ways in which futsal can be used to develop the technical and tactical skills of players of all abilities.</p>
<p>Aimed at coaches of all levels and ages, Developing the Modern Footballer through Futsal is a concise and practical book that provides an easy-to-understand and comprehensive guide to the ways in which futsal can be used as a development tool for football. From defending and attacking to transitional play and goalkeeping, this book provides something for everyone and aims to get you up-and-running fast.</p>
<p>Over 50 detailed sessions are provided, with each one related to specific football scenarios and detailing how performance in these scenarios can be improved through futsal. From gegenpressing to innovative creative play under pressure, this book outlines how futsal can be used to develop a wide range of football-specific skills, giving your players the edge.</p>
<p>About The Authors. Michael Skubala is the England Futsal Manager. Before this, he was the Assistant Coach, a position he held for five years.

<p><em>Summary:</em> Well written and thoughtful. Takes us on a tour of some of Europe's most innovative football thinkers - Financial Times The future of football is now. Football's data revolution has only just begun. The arrival of advanced metrics and detailed analysis is already reshaping the modern game. We can now fully assess player performance, analyse the role of luck and measure what really leads to victory. There is no turning back. Now the race is on between football's wealthiest clubs and a group of outsiders, nerds and rule-breakers, who are turning the game on its head with their staggering innovations. Winning is no longer just about what happens out on the pitch, it's now a battle taking place in boardrooms and on screens across international borders with the world's brightest minds driving for an edge over their fiercest rivals. Christoph Biermann has moved in the midst of these disruptive upheavals, talking to scientists, coaches, managers, scouts and psychologists in the world's major clubs, traveling across Europe and the US and revealing the hidden - and often jaw-dropping - truths behind the beautiful game. 'A book full of exciting ideas and inside views on modern football. The most exciting book in an exciting time for football.' Thomas Hitzlsperger</p>

<p><em>Summary:</em> It started with a question, "What are the fundamentals of football?"</p>
<p>Whilst there are hundreds of books that look into the specific principles of coaches like Jurgen Klopp, Pep Guardiola, and Marcelo Bielsa, there is no core, distilled text on the key principles of the game.</p>
<p>Until now.</p>
<p>Join best-selling author and coach Peter Prickett as he puts football under the microscope and breaks it down into its constituent parts. By addressing the two primary phases in-possession and out-of-possession the book examines the five attacking and five defending principles, plus the transitions between each phase, to reveal the underlying heart of the beautiful game.</p>
<p>These principles have underpinned coach education for decades and largely been unchallenged. When examining them, other deeper values emerge to support the one true principle to score.</p>
<p>Designed for coaches and football fans interested in the theory of football, this handbook is a must-read for anyone looking to understand the foundations that football is built on.</p>
<p>Peter Prickett is an FA affiliate tutor with a decade of experience coaching with various organisations, and the author of the internationally best-selling books on "Developing Skill: Guides to 3v3 Soccer Coaching". He was one of the first coaches in England to obtain the UEFA B Futsal qualification, and has a Masters in Performance Football Coaching.</p>

<p><em>Summary:</em> Many of the top professional soccer players played futsal in their youth--Pel�, Luis Figo, Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Xavi, and Fabregas--and have stated that playing the game made them the great players they are today. Futsal is an exciting, fast moving game of technique, skill, tactics, and physical endeavor. Players undertake the ultimate challenge by testing their skills under the most intense pressure, due to the lack of time and space, stressing the importance of quick reaction times and reflex training. Often used in the off season for soccer players, futsal is due to be placed at the heart of all development programs, improving technique and increasing fun in youth training. Coaches face huge tactical challenges as the game changes minute by minute. It is for these reasons that Futsal has taken a huge grip upon the soccer landscape and the development of players from grassroots upwards. This book is ideal in assisting players and coaches in honing their futsal skills and techniques. If you want to be the new Messi, Ronaldo, or Fabregas, can you afford not to read this book?</p>

<p><em>Summary:</em> The Soccer eyeQ methodology is a proven and successful coaching method to increase scanning and improve game awareness, to provide your players with the tools to make better decisions. Pep Guardiola: "Taking the right decision in the right moment. That is the most difficult thing in football." You will learn how to train scanning and game awareness through innovative training practices. Your players (and team) will take in information quicker, create a picture of what's around them, create an essential habit, and greatly enhance their decision making skills. Too many players focus intently on the ball, control it, and only then look up to see the options. The Soccer eyeQ practices use simple constraints which force players to scan more frequently and read the game situation. With the "picture" created, your players will be quicker, sharper, and make better decisions in all situations. The top players in the world scan the most and this is your chance to develop your players and improve their game awareness to scan like the best; De Bruyne, Mbappe, De Jong, Xavi, Fabregas, Iniesta, Henry, Lampard, and Gerrard. Xavi: "Think quickly, look for spaces. That's what I do: look for spaces. All day. I'm always looking. All day, all day." The Soccer eyeQ methods can be easily added into your training sessions to increase scanning, making players faster and more effective in training and matches. See More - Think Quicker - Play Better!

<p><em>Summary:</em> In 2002 Brazil national team coach Luiz Felipe Scolari actively used The Art of War for Brazil's successful World Cup campaign. Not only did Scolari read the book and apply its strategies, but on some occasions he actually slipped copies of the text underneath his players' doors during the night. Commenting on his use of The Art of War after the World Cup win, Scolari confirmed "sometimes a different approach like this can help." Quite the understatement.Composed in the late 5th century BCE, The Art of War by Chinese general Sun Tzu is the most well-known and well-respected work on military strategy and philosophy in history. Proving its timeless brilliance, the now 2400-year-old text is still used in teaching strategy and philosophy at the leading military academies today. The Art of War is used as instructional material at the US Military Academy at West Point and it is also recommended reading for Royal Officer cadets at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst. Business Insider magazine names The Art of War as one of the top 25 most influential books ever written, and highly respected astrophysicist and social commentator Neil deGrasse Tyson identifies Sun Tzu's work as one of the "seven books every intelligent person on the planet should read." The Art of War and Sun Tzu have been referenced and quoted in various movies and television shows, including "Wall Street," "The Rock," "The Family Man" "Bandits," and the James Bond movie "Die Another Day". In television, The Art of War has been referenced countless times, including in two of the most popular and most critically acclaimed shows of all time: "The Sopranos" (season 3, episode 9) and "Breaking Bad (season 2, episode 7). Most significantly for this project, The Art of War has been applied in sports, and not just by Scolari. NFL coach Bill Belichick, the coach with the most Super Bowl victories of all time, has stated on multiple occasions his admiration for The Art of War, with one specific headline reading "Belichick explains how advice from Sun Tzu's 'The Art of War' helped build the Patriots dynasty." The advocation for Sun Tzu's strategies in all walks of life, including sports, could hardly be higher.</p>
