= Code - General Implementation

== Before You Begin

* CDG-1 Do you understand the design you are about to construct?
* CDG-2 Does the design provide an appropriate level of detail for coding to begin?
* CDG-3 Is the design to be implemented straightforward and feasible, or should it be revisited before attempting to construct it?
* CDG-4 Do you understand the language and technology well enough to implement the design?

== General

* CDG-5 Is the code written in terms of the problem domain as much as possible rather than in terms of computer-science or programming language structures?
* CDG-6 Is the code traceable to upstream design and requirements artifacts?
* CDG-7 Does the code have documented test cases and/or unit tests as defined by the project?
* CDG-8 Does the code adhere to the designated coding standard?
* CDG-9 Does the code adhere to designated coding styles and / or templates?
* CDG-10 Does the code compile with no warnings from the compiler?

== Understandability

* CDG-11 Does the code read from top to bottom?
* CDG-12 Are implementation details hidden as much as possible?
* CDG-13 Is the code straightforward and does it avoid "cleverness"?
* CDG-14 Has tricky code been rewritten rather than commented?
* CDG-15 Do you thoroughly understand your code?
* CDG-16 Is it easy to understand?

== Performance

* CDG-17 Are the affects of resource constraints on the technology and operational environment understood and within the bounds of the performance requirements?
* CDG-18 Are the affects of system load on the technology and operational environment understood and within the bounds of the performance requirements?
* CDG-19 Is the expected priority of efficient or highly optimized code clear for various areas of the system?
* CDG-20 Has profiling support been planned for areas of the code at risk for performance issues?

== Assertions and Tracing

* CDG-21 Are assertions used to document assumptions?
* CDG-22 Are assertions used to aid debugging?
* CDG-23 Are tracing statements used to document events and aid debugging?
* CDG-24 Assertions are not being used to handle errors that should be handled in the code?

== Error Handling

* CDG-25 Is it easy to differentiate between nominal path processing and error processing?
* CDG-26 Are error conditions handled appropriately as per the requirements and design? (i.e., the level of robustness in detecting and responding to errors matches the needs of the system: not too little and not too much).
* CDG-27 When attempting recovery from error conditions, are assumptions reasonable?

== Code Changes

* CDG-28 Is the change part of a systematic change strategy?
* CDG-29 Has the change been reviewed as thoroughly as initial development would be?
* CDG-30 Does the change enhance the program's internal quality rather than degrading it?
* CDG-31 Have you improved the system's modularity by breaking routines into smaller routines, when possible?
* CDG-32 Have you improved the programming styleâ€“variable names, routine names, formatting, comments, and so on?
* CDG-33 If changes cause you to look for ways to share code, have you considered putting the shared code at a higher level as well as considered putting it at a lower level?
* CDG-34 Does this change make the next change easier?

== Layout

* CDG-35 Does the program's layout show its logical structure?
* CDG-36 Is formatting done primarily to illuminate the logical structure of the code?
* CDG-37 Is the formatting scheme used consistently?
* CDG-38 Are related statements grouped together?
* CDG-39 Are blank lines used to separate code elements including functions, control sequences, related blocks of code, etc?
* CDG-40 Does the formatting scheme result in code that's easy to maintain?
* CDG-41 Does the formatting scheme improve code readability?
* CDG-42 Have relatively independent groups of statements been moved into their own routines?
* CDG-43 Are references to variables as close together as possible, both in total live time and from each reference to a variable to the next?

== Individual Statements

* CDG-44 Are continuation lines indented sensibly?
* CDG-45 Are groups of related statements aligned?
* CDG-46 Are groups of unrelated statements unaligned?
* CDG-47 Does each line contain one statement?
* CDG-48 Is each statement written without side effects?
* CDG-49 Are data declarations aligned?
* CDG-50 Is there one data declaration per line?
