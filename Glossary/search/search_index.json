It does so by adding additional behavior to existing code (an advice) without modifying the code itself, instead separately specifying which code is modified via a \"pointcut\" specification, such as \"log all function calls when the function's name begins with 'set'\". This allows behaviors that are not central to the business logic (such as logging) to be added to a program without cluttering the code, core to the functionality.

Nearly all programming paradigms support some level of grouping and encapsulation of concerns into separate, independent entities by providing abstractions (e.g., functions, procedures, modules, classes, methods) that can be used for implementing, abstracting and composing these concerns. Some concerns \"cut across\" multiple abstractions in a program, and defy these forms of implementation. These concerns are called cross-cutting concerns or horizontal concerns.</p> <p>Logging exemplifies a crosscutting concern because a logging strategy necessarily affects every logged part of the system. Logging thereby crosscuts all logged classes and methods.</p> <p>All AOP implementations have some crosscutting expressions that encapsulate each concern in one place. The difference between implementations lies in the power, safety, and usability of the constructs provided. For example, interceptors that specify the methods to intercept express a limited form of crosscutting, without much support for type-safety or debugging. AspectJ has a number of such expressions and encapsulates them in a special class, an aspect. For example, an aspect can alter the behavior of the base code (the non-aspect part of a program) by applying advice (additional behavior) at various join points (points in a program) specified in a quantification or query called a pointcut (that detects whether a given join point matches).

Examples of audio coding formats include MP3, AAC, Vorbis, FLAC, and Opus. A specific software or hardware implementation capable of audio compression and decompression to/from a specific audio coding format is called an audio codec; an example of an audio codec is LAME, which is one of several different codecs which implements encoding and decoding audio in the MP3 audio coding format in software.</p> <p>Some audio coding formats are documented by a detailed technical specification document known as an audio coding specification. Some such specifications are written and approved by standardization organizations as technical standards, and are thus known as an audio coding standard. The term \"standard\" is also sometimes used for de facto standards as well as formal standards.</p> <p>Audio content encoded in a particular audio coding format is normally encapsulated within a container format. As such, the user normally doesn't have a raw AAC file, but instead has a .m4a audio file, which is a MPEG-4 Part 14 container containing AAC-encoded audio. The container also contains metadata such as title and other tags, and perhaps an index for fast seeking. A notable exception is MP3 files, which are raw audio coding without a container format. De facto standards for adding metadata tags such as title and artist to MP3s, such as ID3, are hacks which work by appending the tags to the MP3, and then relying on the MP3 player to recognize the chunk as malformed audio coding and therefore skip it. In video files with audio, the encoded audio content is bundled with video (in a video coding format) inside a multimedia container format.</p> <p>An audio coding format does not dictate all algorithms used by a codec implementing the format. An important part of how lossy audio compression works is by removing data in ways humans can't hear, according to a psychoacoustic model; the implementer of an encoder has some freedom of choice in which data to remove (according to their psychoacoustic model).\\ </p>"},{"location":"a/Audit/","title":"Audit","text":"<p>Sometimes used as a synonym for\u00a0assessment,\u00a0usually in a more formal and independent context.</p>"},{"location":"a/Author/","title":"Author","text":"<p>For a\u00a0review, the person assigned to represent the author viewpoint for an\u00a0artifact.

The encoder also keeps the previous N bits of output (N = 3 or N = 4 are very common) to determine adjustments to the step size; if the previous N bits are all 1s or 0s, the step size is increased. Otherwise, the step size is decreased (usually in an exponential manner, with {<code>\\displaystyle</code>{=tex}<code>\\tau</code>{=tex}} <code>\\tau</code>{=tex}being in the range of 5 ms).

It is based on the layered VLAN tags and MAC-in-MAC encapsulation defined in IEEE 802.1ah (Provider Backbone Bridges (PBB)), but it differs from PBB in eliminating flooding, dynamically created forwarding tables, and spanning tree protocols. Compared to PBB and its predecessors, PBB-TE behaves more predictably and its behavior can be more easily controlled by the network operator, at the expense of requiring up-front connection configuration at each bridge along a forwarding path.

It was initially based on Nortel's Provider Backbone Transport (PBT).</p> <p>PBB-TE's connection-oriented features and behaviors, as well as its OAM approach, are inspired by SDH/SONET.

Each PBB-TE trunk is identified by a triplet of B-SA, B-DA and B-VID. The B-SA and B-DA identify the source and destination bridges, respectively, that are the endpoints of the trunk. The B-VID is a backbone VLAN identifier that is used to distinguish different trunks to the same destination. The management system configures the PBB-TE trunks on all the edge and core bridges by creating static forwarding database entries; the management system is responsible for ensuring that there are no forwarding loops.</p> <p>The backbone edge bridges map frames to and from an I-SID and perform the MAC header encapsulation and decapsulation functions. The core bridges act as transit nodes. The packets are forwarded based on outer VLAN ID (B-VID) and Destination MAC address (B-DA).</p> <p>Forwarding is based on the static forwarding database (FDB) entries; dynamic MAC learning is not used. Any incoming broadcast or multicast frames are either dropped or encapsulated as unicast within the trunk. All Destination Lookup Failure packets are dropped rather than flooded. By eliminating any broadcasting or flooding, and by using only the loop-free forwarding paths configured by management, there is no longer any need to use a spanning tree protocol.</p> <p>Path protection is provided by configuring one work and one protect B-VID for each backbone service instance.

In addition to improving subjective audio quality, echo suppression increases the capacity achieved through silence suppression by preventing echo from traveling across a network. Echo suppressors were developed in the 1950s in response to the first use of satellites for telecommunications, but they have since been largely supplanted by better performing echo cancellers.</p> <p>Echo suppression and cancellation methods are commonly called acoustic echo suppression (AES) and acoustic echo cancellation (AEC), and more rarely line echo cancellation (LEC). In some cases, these terms are more precise, as there are various types and causes of echo with unique characteristics, including acoustic echo (sounds from a loudspeaker being reflected and recorded by a microphone, which can vary substantially over time) and line echo (electrical impulses caused by, e.g., coupling between the sending and receiving wires, impedance mismatches, electrical reflections, etc., which varies much less than acoustic echo). In practice, however, the same techniques are used to treat all types of echo, so an acoustic echo canceller can cancel line echo as well as acoustic echo. AEC in particular is commonly used to refer to echo cancelers in general, regardless of whether they were intended for acoustic echo, line echo, or both.</p> <p>Although echo suppressors and echo cancellers have similar goals---preventing a speaking individual from hearing an echo of their own voice---the methods they use are different:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Echo suppressors work by detecting a voice signal going in one     direction on a circuit, and then muting or attenuating the signal in     other direction.

The title is Security Requirements\u00a0for\u00a0Cryptographic Modules. Initial publication was on May 25, 2001 and was last updated December 3, 2002</p> <p>Purpose\\ The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) issued the FIPS 140 Publication Series to coordinate the requirements and standards\u00a0for\u00a0cryptography modules that include both hardware and software components. Protection of a cryptographic module within a security system is necessary to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of the information\u00a0protected\u00a0by the module. This standard specifies the security requirements that will be satisfied by a cryptographic module. The standard provides four increasing, qualitative levels of security intended to cover a wide range of potential applications and environments. The security requirements cover areas related to the secure design and implementation of a cryptographic module. These areas include cryptographic module specification; cryptographic module ports and interfaces; roles, services, and authentication; finite state model; physical security; operational environment; cryptographic key management; electromagnetic interference/electromagnetic compatibility (EMI/EMC); self-tests; design assurance; and mitigation of other attacks.</p> <p>Federal agencies and departments can validate that the module in use is covered by an existing FIPS 140-1 or FIPS 140-2 certificate that specifies the exact module name, hardware, software, firmware, and/or applet version numbers. The cryptographic modules are produced by the\u00a0private\u00a0sector or open source communities\u00a0for\u00a0use by the U.S. government and other regulated industries (such as financial and health-care institutions) that collect, store, transfer, share and disseminate sensitive but unclassified (SBU) information. A commercial cryptographic module is also commonly referred to as a hardware security module (HSM).</p> <p>Security levels\\ FIPS 140-2 defines four levels of security, simply named \"Level 1\" to \"Level 4\". It does not specify in detail what level of security is required by any particular application.</p> <p>Level 1\\ Security Level 1 provides the lowest level of security. Basic security requirements are specified\u00a0for\u00a0a cryptographic module (e.g., at least one Approved algorithm or Approved security function shall be used). No specific physical security mechanisms are required in a Security Level 1 cryptographic module beyond the basic requirement\u00a0for\u00a0production-grade components. An example of a Security Level 1 cryptographic module is a personal computer (PC) encryption board.</p> <p>Level 2\\ Security Level 2 improves upon the physical security mechanisms of a Security Level 1 cryptographic module by requiring features that show evidence of tampering, including tamper-evident coatings or seals that must be broken to attain physical access to the plaintext cryptographic keys and critical security parameters (CSPs) within the module, or pick-resistant locks on covers or doors to protect against unauthorized physical access.</p> <p>Level 3\\ In addition to the tamper-evident physical security mechanisms required at Security Level 2, Security Level 3 attempts to prevent the intruder from gaining access to CSPs held within the cryptographic module. Physical security mechanisms required at Security Level 3 are intended to have a high probability of detecting and responding to attempts at physical access, use or modification of the cryptographic module. The physical security mechanisms may include the use of strong enclosures and tamper-detection/response circuitry that zeroes all plaintext CSPs when the removable covers/doors of the cryptographic module are opened.</p> <p>Level 4\\ Security Level 4 provides the highest level of security. At this security level, the physical security mechanisms provide a complete envelope of protection around the cryptographic module with the intent of detecting and responding to all unauthorized attempts at physical access. Penetration of the cryptographic module enclosure from any direction has a very high probability of being detected, resulting in the immediate deletion of all plaintext CSPs.</p> <p>Security Level 4 cryptographic modules are useful\u00a0for\u00a0operation in physically unprotected environments. Security Level 4 also protects a cryptographic module against a security compromise due to environmental conditions or fluctuations outside of the module's normal operating ranges\u00a0for\u00a0voltage and temperature. Intentional excursions beyond the normal operating ranges may be used by an attacker to thwart a cryptographic module's defenses. A cryptographic module is required to either include special environmental protection features designed to detect fluctuations and delete CSPs, or to undergo rigorous environmental failure testing to provide a reasonable assurance that the module will not be affected by fluctuations outside of the normal operating range in a manner that can compromise the security of the module.</p>"},{"location":"f/FIPS/","title":"FIPS","text":"<p>Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) are publicly announced standards developed by the United States federal government for use in computer systems by non-military government agencies and government contractors.</p> <p>FIPS standards are issued to establish requirements for various purposes such as ensuring computer security and interoperability, and are intended for cases in which suitable industry standards do not already exist.

G.711, also known as Pulse Code Modulation (PCM), is a very commonly used waveform codec. G.711 is a narrowband audio codec that provides toll-quality audio at 64 kbit/s. G.711 passes audio signals in the range of 300--3400 Hz and samples them at the rate of 8,000 samples per second, with the tolerance on that rate of 50 parts per million (ppm). Non-uniform (logarithmic) quantization with 8 bits is used to represent each sample, resulting in a 64 kbit/s bit rate.

Using different syntax and symbolic representation, the two protocols are not directly interoperable. They are both complementary to H.323 and the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) protocols.</p> <p>H.248 was the result of collaboration of the MEGACO working group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Study Group 16. The IETF originally published the standard as RFC 3015, which was superseded by RFC 3525. The term Megaco is the IETF designation. Megaco combines concepts from MGCP and the Media Device Control Protocol (MDCP). MGCP originated from a combination of the Simple Gateway Control Protocol (SGCP) with the Internet Protocol Device Control (IPDC).</p> <p>After the ITU took responsibility of the protocol maintenance, the IETF reclassified its publications as historic in RFC 5125. The ITU has published three versions of H.248, the most recent in September 2005. H.248 encompasses not only the base protocol specification in H.248.1, but many extensions defined throughout the H.248 sub-series.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"h/H.323/","title":"H.323","text":"<p>H.323 is a recommendation from the ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) that defines the protocols to provide audio-visual communication sessions on any packet network.

Historically, mobile phones have provided voice call services over a circuit-switched-style network, rather than strictly over an IP packet-switched network. Alternative methods of delivering voice (VoIP) or other multimedia services have become available on smartphones, but they have not become standardized across the industry. IMS is an architectural framework to provide such standardization.</p> <p>IMS was originally designed by the wireless standards body 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), as a part of the vision for evolving mobile networks beyond GSM. Its original formulation (3GPP Rel-5) represented an approach for delivering Internet services over GPRS. This vision was later updated by 3GPP, 3GPP2 and ETSI TISPAN by requiring support of networks other than GPRS, such as Wireless LAN, CDMA2000 and fixed lines.</p> <p>IMS uses IETF protocols wherever possible, e.g., the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). According to the 3GPP, IMS is not intended to standardize applications, but rather to aid the access of multimedia and voice applications from wireless and wireline terminals, i.e., to create a form of fixed-mobile convergence (FMC). This is done by having a horizontal control layer that isolates the access network from the service layer. From a logical architecture perspective, services need not have their own control functions, as the control layer is a common horizontal layer.

The maximum jitter that can be countered by a de-jitter buffer is equal to the buffering delay introduced before starting the play-out of the mediastream. In the context of packet-switched networks, the term packet delay variation is often preferred over jitter.</p> <p>Some systems use sophisticated delay-optimal de-jitter buffers that are capable of adapting the buffering delay to changing network jitter characteristics. These are known as adaptive de-jitter buffers and the adaptation logic is based on the jitter estimates computed from the arrival characteristics of the media packets. Adaptive de-jittering involves introducing discontinuities in the media play-out, which may appear offensive to the listener or viewer. Adaptive de-jittering is usually carried out for audio play-outs that feature a VAD/DTX encoded audio, that allows the lengths of the silence periods to be adjusted, thus minimizing the perceptual impact of the adaptation.</p> <p>Packet jitter in computer networks\\ In the context of computer networks, jitter is the variation in latency as measured in the variability over time of the packet latency across a network. A network with constant latency has no variation (or jitter). Packet jitter is expressed as an average of the deviation from the network mean latency. However, for this use, the term is imprecise. The standards-based term is \"packet delay variation\" (PDV). PDV is an important quality of service factor in assessment of network performance.</p> <p>Burst transmission or burstiness, i.e.\u00a0transmitting a burst of traffic at a high rate followed by an interval or period of lower or zero rate transmission, may also be seen as a form of jitter, as it represents a deviation from the average transmission rate. However, unlike the jitter caused by variation in latency, transmitting in bursts is commonly seen a desirable feature, e.g.\u00a0in variable bitrate transmissions. Usage/Network Parameter Control (UPC and NPC), as implemented in ATM networks, allows both a Maximum Burst Size (MBS) parameter on the average or Sustained Cell Rate (SCR), and a Cell Delay Variation tolerance (CDVt) on the Peak Cell Rate (PCR) at which the bursts are transmitted. This MBS can be derived from or used to derive the maximum variation between the arrival time of traffic in the bursts from the time it would arrive at the SCR, i.e.\u00a0a jitter about that SCR.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"j/Jitter/","title":"Jitter","text":"<p>In electronics and telecommunications, jitter is the deviation from true periodicity of a presumably periodic signal, often in relation to a reference clock signal.

The specification for eMTC (LTE Cat-M1) was frozen in 3GPP Release 13 (LTE Advanced Pro), in June 2016. Other 3GPP IoT technologies include NB-IoT and EC-GSM-IoT.</p> <p>The advantage of LTE-M over NB-IoT is its comparatively higher data rate, mobility, and voice over the network, but it requires more bandwidth, is more costly, and cannot be put into guard band frequency band for now. Compared to LTE Release 12 Cat-0 modem, an LTE-M model is claimed to be 80% less expensive (in terms of the bill of materials), support up to 18 dB better coverage, and a battery lifetime than can last up to several years. In March 2019, the Global Mobile Suppliers Association reported that over 100 operators had deployed/launched either NB-IoT or LTE-M networks.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Downlink Peak Rate:\u00a01 Mbit</p> </li> <li> <p>Uplink Peak Rate:\u00a01 Mbit</p> </li> <li> <p>Latency:\u00a010-15 ms</p> </li> <li> <p>Duplex Technology:\u00a0Half Duplex</p> </li> <li> <p>Device Receive Bandwidth:\u00a01.4MHz to 5MHz</p> </li> <li> <p>Device Transmit Power:\u00a020 dBm</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"l/LTE%20and%20Mobile%20Internet/","title":"LTE and Mobile Internet","text":""},{"location":"l/LTS/","title":"LTS","text":"<p>L2TP Tunnel Switch</p> <p>L2TP tunnel switching, also known as L2TP multihop, simplifies the deployment of an L2TP network across multiple domains.

Potential contributors to latency in an audio system include analog-to-digital conversion, buffering, digital signal processing, transmission time, digital-to-analog conversion and the speed of sound in the transmission medium.</p> <p>Latency can be a critical performance metric in professional audio including sound reinforcement systems, foldback systems (especially those using in-ear monitors) live radio and television. Excessive audio latency has the potential to degrade call quality in telecommunications applications. Low latency audio in computers is important for interactivity.</p> <p>Telephone calls\\ In all systems, latency can be said to consist of three elements: codec delay, playout delay and network delay.</p> <p>Latency in telephone calls is sometimes referred to as mouth-to-ear delay; the telecommunications industry also uses the term quality of experience (QoE). Voice quality is measured according to the ITU model; measurable quality of a call degrades rapidly where the mouth-to-ear delay latency exceeds 200 milliseconds. The mean opinion score (MOS) is also comparable in a near-linear fashion with the ITU's quality scale - defined in standards G.107 (page 800),G.108 and G.109 - with a quality factor R ranging from 0 to 100. An MOS of 4 ('Good') would have an R score of 80 or above; to achieve 100R requires an MOS exceeding 4.5.</p> <p>Cellular calls\\ The AMR narrowband codec, used currently in UMTS networks, is a low bitrate, highly compressed, adaptive bitrate codec achieving rates from 4.75 to 12.2 kbit/s with 'toll quality' (MOS 4.0 or above) from 7.4 kbit/s. 2G networks use the AMR-12.2 codec, equivalent to GSM-EFR. As mobile operators upgrade existing best-effort networks to support concurrent multiple types of service over all-IP networks, services such as Hierarchical Quality of Service (H-QoS) allow for per-user, per-service QoS policies to prioritise time-sensitive protocols like voice calls and other wireless backhaul traffic. Along with more efficient voice codecs, this helps to maintain a sufficient MOS rating whilst the volume of overall traffic on often oversubscribed mobile networks increases with demand.</p> <p>Another overlooked aspect of mobile latency is the inter-network handoff; as a customer on Network A calls a Network B customer the call must traverse two separate Radio Access Networks, two core networks and an interlinking Gateway Mobile Switching Centre (GMSC) which performs the physical interconnecting between the two providers.</p> <p>IP calls\\ On a stable connection with sufficient bandwidth and minimal latency, VoIP systems typically have a minimum of 20 ms inherent latency and target 150 ms as a maximum latency for general consumer use. With end-to-end QoS managed and assured rate connections, latency can be reduced to analogue PSTN/POTS levels. Latency is a larger consideration in these systems when an echo is present therefore popular VoIP codecs such as G.729 perform complex voice detection and noise suppression.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"l/Lawful%20intercept/","title":"Lawful intercept","text":"<p>Lawful interception (LI) refers to the facilities in telecommunications and telephone networks that allow law enforcement agencies with court order or other legal authorization to selectively wiretap individual subscribers.

Additionally, the MAC is also responsible for compensating for congestion and collisions by initiating retransmission if a jam signal is detected, and/or negotiating a slower transmission rate if necessary.

The general idea behind the NGN is that one network transports all information and services (voice, data, and all sorts of media such as video) by encapsulating these into IP packets, similar to those used on the Internet. NGNs are commonly built around the Internet Protocol, and therefore the term all IP is also sometimes used to describe the transformation of formerly telephone-centric networks toward NGN.</p> <p>According to ITU-T, the definition is:</p> <p>A next-generation network (NGN) is a packet-based network which can provide services including Telecommunication Services and is able to make use of multiple broadband, quality of Service-enabled transport technologies and in which service-related functions are independent from underlying transport-related technologies. It offers unrestricted access by users to different service providers. It supports generalized mobility which will allow consistent and ubiquitous provision of services to users.\\ From a practical perspective, NGN involves three main architectural changes that need to be looked at separately:</p> <ul> <li> <p>In the core network, NGN implies a consolidation of several     (dedicated or overlay) transport networks each historically built     for a different service into one core transport network (often based     on IP and Ethernet). It implies amongst others the migration of     voice from a circuit-switched architecture (PSTN) to VoIP, and also     migration of legacy services such as X.25, frame relay (either     commercial migration of the customer to a new service like IP VPN,     or technical emigration by emulation of the \"legacy service\" on the     NGN).</p> </li> <li> <p>In the wired access network, NGN implies the migration from the dual     system of legacy voice next to xDSL setup in local exchanges to a     converged setup in which the DSLAMs integrate voice ports or VoIP,     making it possible to remove the voice switching infrastructure from     the exchange.[2]</p> </li> <li> <p>In the cable access network, NGN convergence implies migration of     constant bit rate voice to CableLabs PacketCable standards that     provide VoIP and SIP services. Both services ride over DOCSIS as the     cable data layer standard.</p> <p>In an NGN, there is a more defined separation between the transport (connectivity) portion of the network and the services that run on top of that transport. This means that whenever a provider wants to enable a new service, they can do so by defining it directly at the service layer without considering the transport layer -- i.e.\u00a0services are independent of transport details. Increasingly applications, including voice, tend to be independent of the access network (de-layering of network and applications) and will reside more on end-user devices (phone, PC, set-top box).</p> <p>Underlying technology components\\ Next-generation networks are based on Internet technologies including Internet Protocol (IP) and multiprotocol label switching (MPLS). At the application level, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) seems to be taking over from ITU-T H.323.</p> <p>Initially H.323 was the most popular protocol, though its popularity decreased in the \"local loop\" due to its original poor traversal of network address translation (NAT) and firewalls. For this reason as domestic VoIP services have been developed, SIP has been more widely adopted. However, in voice networks where everything is under the control of the network operator or telco, many of the largest carriers use H.323 as the protocol of choice in their core backbones.[citation needed] With the most recent changes introduced for H.323, it is now possible for H.323 devices to easily and consistently traverse NAT and firewall devices, opening up the possibility that H.323 may again be looked upon more favorably in cases where such devices encumbered its use previously. Nonetheless, most of the telcos are extensively researching and supporting IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), which gives SIP a major chance of being the most widely adopted protocol.</p> <p>For voice applications one of the most important devices in NGN is a Softswitch -- a programmable device that controls Voice over IP (VoIP) calls. It enables correct integration of different protocols within NGN. The most important function of the Softswitch is creating the interface to the existing telephone network, PSTN, through Signalling Gateways and Media Gateways. However, the Softswitch as a term may be defined differently by the different equipment manufacturers and have somewhat different functions.</p> <p>One may quite often find the term Gatekeeper in NGN literature. This was originally a VoIP device, which converted (using gateways) voice and data from their analog or digital switched-circuit form (PSTN, SS7) to the packet-based one (IP). It controlled one or more gateways. As soon as this kind of device started using the Media Gateway Control Protocol, the name was changed to Media Gateway Controller (MGC).</p> <p>A Call Agent is a general name for devices/systems controlling calls.</p> <p>The IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) is a standardised NGN architecture for an Internet media-services capability defined by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"n/NGWFQ/","title":"NGWFQ","text":"<p>Weighted Fair Queueing</p> <p>See PWFQ\\ Weighted fair queueing (WFQ) is a network scheduler scheduling algorithm.

Barriers to the greater adoption of NoSQL stores include the use of low-level query languages (instead of SQL,\u00a0for\u00a0instance the lack of ability to perform ad-hoc joins across tables), lack of standardized interfaces, and huge previous investments in existing relational databases.[ Most NoSQL stores lack true ACID transactions, although a few databases, such as MarkLogic, Aerospike, FairCom c-treeACE, Google Spanner (though technically a NewSQL database), Symas LMDB, and OrientDB have made them central to their designs. (See ACID and join support.)</p> <p>Instead, most NoSQL databases offer a concept of \"eventual consistency\" in which database changes are propagated to all nodes \"eventually\" (typically within milliseconds) so queries\u00a0for\u00a0data might not return updated data immediately or might result in reading data that is not accurate, a problem known as stale reads. Additionally, some NoSQL systems may exhibit lost writes and other forms of data loss. Some NoSQL systems provide concepts such as write-ahead logging to avoid data loss.\u00a0For\u00a0distributed transaction processing across multiple databases, data consistency is an even bigger challenge that is difficult\u00a0for\u00a0both NoSQL and relational databases. Even current relational databases \"do not allow referential integrity constraints to span databases.\" There are few systems that maintain both ACID transactions and X/Open XA standards\u00a0for\u00a0distributed transaction processing.</p>"},{"location":"n/Node%20B/","title":"Node B","text":"<p>Node B is the telecommunications node in particular mobile communication networks, namely those that adhere to the UMTS standard.

Other paradigms are concerned mainly with the way that code is organized, such as grouping a code into units along with the state that is modified by the code. Yet others are concerned mainly with the style of syntax and grammar.</p> <p>Common programming paradigms include:</p> <ul> <li> <p>imperative which allows side effects,</p> </li> <li> <p>object-oriented which groups code together with the state the         code modifies,</p> </li> <li> <p>procedural which groups code into functions,</p> </li> <li> <p>declarative which does not state the order in which operations     execute,</p> </li> <li> <p>functional which disallows side effects,</p> </li> <li> <p>logic which has a particular style of execution model coupled to         a particular style of syntax and grammar, and</p> </li> <li> <p>symbolic programming which has a particular style of syntax and     grammar.</p> <p>For example, languages that fall into the imperative paradigm have two main features: they state the order in which operations occur, with constructs that explicitly control that order, and they allow side effects, in which state can be modified at one point in time, within one unit of code, and then later read at a different point in time inside a different unit of code. The communication between the units of code is not explicit. Meanwhile, in object-oriented programming, code is organized into objects that contain state that is only modified by the code that is part of the object. Most object-oriented languages are also imperative languages. In contrast, languages that fit the declarative paradigm do not state the order in which to execute operations. Instead, they supply a number of operations that are available in the system, along with the conditions under which each is allowed to execute. The implementation of the language's execution model tracks which operations are free to execute and chooses the order on its own.

A packet analyzer can also be referred to as a network analyzer or protocol analyzer though these terms also have other meanings.</p> <p>Capabilities\\ On wired shared medias networks, such as Ethernet, Token Ring, and FDDI networks, depending on the network structure (hub or switch), it may be possible to capture all traffic on the network from a single machine on the network. On modern networks, traffic can be captured using a network switch with a so-called monitoring port that mirrors all packets that pass through designated ports of the switch. A network tap is an even more reliable solution than to use a monitoring port, since taps are less likely to drop packets during high traffic load.</p> <p>On wireless LANs, traffic can be captured on one channel at a time, or by using multiple adapters, on several channels simultaneously.</p> <p>On wired broadcast and wireless LANs, to capture unicast traffic between other machines, the network adapter capturing the traffic must be in promiscuous mode. On wireless LANs, even if the adapter is in promiscuous mode, packets not for the service set the adapter is configured for are usually ignored. To see those packets, the adapter must be in monitor mode. No special provisions are required to capture multicast traffic to a multicast group the packet analyzer is already monitoring, or broadcast traffic.</p> <p>When traffic is captured, either the entire contents of packets are recorded, or just the headers are recorded. Recording just headers reduces storage requirements, and avoids some legal issues, yet often provides sufficient information to diagnose problems.</p> <p>Captured information is decoded from raw digital form into a human-readable format that lets users easily review exchanged information.

RRC messages are transported via the PDCP-Protocol.</p> <p>The major functions of the RRC protocol include connection establishment and release functions, broadcast of system information, radio bearer establishment, reconfiguration and release, RRC connection mobility procedures, paging notification and release and outer loop power control. By means of the signalling functions the RRC configures the user and control planes according to the network status and allows for Radio Resource Management strategies to be implemented.</p> <p>The operation of the RRC is guided by a state machine which defines certain specific states that a UE may be present in. The different states in this state machine have different amounts of radio resources associated with them and these are the resources that the UE may use when it is present in a given specific state. Since different amounts of resources are available at different states the quality of the service that the user experiences and the energy consumption of the UE are influenced by this state machine.</p> <p>In order to comprehend the Radio Resource Control (RRC) state machine, we should study the architecture of the third generation mobile cellular system, the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). The UMTS is composed by two subsystems, the UTRAN (Umts Terrestrial Radio Access Network) and CN (core network) :\\ </p> <p>The RNC is responsible for the packet scheduling, radio resource control and handover control.\\ Unlike other wireless technologies like WIFI in which clients concurrently send packets and collisions occur (and backoff algorithms), in the UMTS there is a centralized entity that schedules resources to each client. In order to manage the UE access to radio resources, the UMTS introduces a radio resource control protocol (RRC) that attributes each UE a specific state machine (based on radio resource usage). This state machine is dependent on the 3G provider and can have different states and/or transitions. According to the reference paper -- Characterizing Radio Resource Allocation for 3G Networks -- the studied networks were composed by three states: IDLE, CELL_FACH and CELL_DCH.\\ In truth other states can actually be observed in some operators before going into a disconnected mode. For example the PCH states -- URA_PCH and CELL_PCH -- are states in which the user equipment has no transport channels allocated but has to monitor the cell/UTRAN it is currently connected to in order to send CELL_UPDATES to the RCN (just in case it actually changes). This update implies temporarily changing the state to a CELL_FACH in order to be able to send data. The change from CELL_PCH, in which the UE is known at a cell level, to URA_PCH, in which the user is known at UTRAN level, may be due to an increasing number of CELL_UPDATES (e.g.\u00a0travelling fast). This is useful in order to speed up incoming connections since it might take around 0.9 seconds to establish it against the 2.5s delay if the UE is on the IDLE state.\\ Below is a diagram that represents the six most common states -- CELL_DCH, CELL_FACH, CELL_PCH, URA_PCH, IDLE, DISCONNECT -- and some of the possible transitions.\\ </p>"},{"location":"r/RSTP/","title":"RSTP","text":"<p>Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol</p> <p>In 2001, the IEEE introduced Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) as 802.1w.

It works in the same way as a risk-return analysis which you may already be familiar with.\\ It can be applied at any level, for example:</p> <ul> <li> <p>by a CEO for comparing different strategic directions for the     company.</p> </li> <li> <p>by a program manager deciding which projects to keep within the     program and which to discard.</p> </li> <li> <p>by a project manager deciding how to sequence tasks</p> </li> <li> <p>or simply by an individual team member deciding how best to spend     their day.</p> <p>The template works by having risk plotted along one axis and reward along the other. In the diagram below I've divided the template into four sections to show you how to interpret the information.</p> <p>\\ The four categories from the diagram above are as follows:</p> <p>Equal Low: where risk and reward are both proportional and low.\\ Equal High: where risk and reward are both proportional and high.\\ Positive: represents a positive risk-reward balance, where a higher return can be achieved with limited risk.\\ Negative: represents a negative risk-reward balance, where a low return is the reward for taking on a relatively high risk.\\ How to Use it\\ First, you need to create a list of all the different options and their possible rewards. This can done quickly and roughly, or can involve serious effort (market research, scenario development etc) -- the effort you put in will depend on the size of the decision you are making. Examples of some options might include: outsourcing non-core activities, stop investing in poorly performing product lines, invest in new products, or investing to move into new markets. Once you have all the options and their potential reward, they should be plotted on the risk-reward chart:\\ \\ At this stage some options will appear to have a more favourable risk-reward profile than others, such as outsourcing in the above example, but it is work taking the time to investigate whether any options can have their risks mitigated, or if there are options that can have their rewards boosted, before making a final decision on which option to go with. In the above example, if the risk of developing new products could be mitigated somehow then that option would become more favourable than outsourcing.</p> <p>Finally, for an even more complete picture to further aid our decision making, we can add resources to the risk-reward template. In the diagram below, the bigger the bubble the more resources are required to execute that option.\\ \\ With risk, reward, and resources all plotted, we are able to trade them against one another to find the best option for us. From the diagram above you can see that outsourcing is probably the most favourable option, providing plenty of upside reward but requiring minimal resource and having little risk. Additionally, with so few resources engaged in making the outsourcing happen, perhaps some investigative work can start on the new product development option with some of the spare resource.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"r/Risk/","title":"Risk","text":"<p>An undesirable outcome.\\ Risks on projects generally refer to the captured representation of a possible future negative impact to a project's feature, budget, schedule, or quality.

The method was developed to replace the plesiochronous digital hierarchy (PDH) system for transporting large amounts of telephone calls and data traffic over the same fiber without synchronization problems.</p> <p>SONET and SDH, which are essentially the same, were originally designed to transport circuit mode communications (e.g., DS1, DS3) from a variety of different sources, but they were primarily designed to support real-time, uncompressed, circuit-switched voice encoded in PCM format.[1] The primary difficulty in doing this prior to SONET/SDH was that the synchronization sources of these various circuits were different. This meant that each circuit was actually operating at a slightly different rate and with different phase.

This results in wasting power on transmissions when there are no mobile units to reach, in addition to causing interference for adjacent cells using the same frequency, so called co-channel cells. Likewise, in reception, the antenna receives signals coming from all directions including noise and interference signals. By using smart antenna technology and differing spatial locations of mobile units within the cell, space-division multiple access techniques offer attractive performance enhancements. The radiation pattern of the base station, both in transmission and reception, is adapted to each user to obtain highest gain in the direction of that user. This is often done using phased array techniques.</p> <p>In GSM cellular networks, the base station is aware of the distance (but not direction) of a mobile phone by use of a technique called \"timing advance\" (TA). The base transceiver station (BTS) can determine how far the mobile station (MS) is by interpreting the reported TA. This information, along with other parameters, can then be used to power down the BTS or MS, if a power control feature is implemented in the network. The power control in either BTS or MS is implemented in most modern networks, especially on the MS, as this ensures a better battery life for the MS.

Semaphores which allow an arbitrary resource count are called counting semaphores, while semaphores which are restricted to the values 0 and 1 (or locked/unlocked, unavailable/available) are called binary semaphores and are used to implement locks.</p>"},{"location":"s/Sematic%20Versioning/","title":"Sematic Versioning","text":"<p>Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:</p> <ol> <li> <p>MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,</p> </li> <li> <p>MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible     manner, and</p> </li> <li> <p>PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.</p> <p></p> <p><code>&lt;valid semver&gt;</code>{=html} ::= <code>&lt;version core&gt;</code>{=html} <code>&lt;version core&gt;</code>{=html} \"-\" <code>&lt;pre-release&gt;</code>{=html} <code>&lt;version core&gt;</code>{=html} \"+\" <code>&lt;build&gt;</code>{=html} <code>&lt;version core&gt;</code>{=html} \"-\" <code>&lt;pre-release&gt;</code>{=html} \"+\" <code>&lt;build&gt;</code>{=html}</p> <p><code>&lt;version core&gt;</code>{=html} ::= <code>&lt;major&gt;</code>{=html} \".\" <code>&lt;minor&gt;</code>{=html} \".\" <code>&lt;patch&gt;</code>{=html}</p> <p><code>&lt;major&gt;</code>{=html} ::= <code>&lt;numeric identifier&gt;</code>{=html}</p> <p><code>&lt;minor&gt;</code>{=html} ::= <code>&lt;numeric identifier&gt;</code>{=html}</p> <p><code>&lt;patch&gt;</code>{=html} ::= <code>&lt;numeric identifier&gt;</code>{=html}</p> <p><code>&lt;pre-release&gt;</code>{=html} ::= <code>&lt;dot-separated pre-release identifiers&gt;</code>{=html}</p> <p><code>&lt;dot-separated pre-release identifiers&gt;</code>{=html} ::= <code>&lt;pre-release identifier&gt;</code>{=html} <code>&lt;pre-release identifier&gt;</code>{=html} \".\" <code>&lt;dot-separated pre-release identifiers&gt;</code>{=html}</p> <p><code>&lt;build&gt;</code>{=html} ::= <code>&lt;dot-separated build identifiers&gt;</code>{=html}</p> <p><code>&lt;dot-separated build identifiers&gt;</code>{=html} ::= <code>&lt;build identifier&gt;</code>{=html} <code>&lt;build identifier&gt;</code>{=html} \".\" <code>&lt;dot-separated build identifiers&gt;</code>{=html}</p> <p><code>&lt;pre-release identifier&gt;</code>{=html} ::= <code>&lt;alphanumeric identifier&gt;</code>{=html} <code>&lt;numeric identifier&gt;</code>{=html}</p> <p><code>&lt;build identifier&gt;</code>{=html} ::= <code>&lt;alphanumeric identifier&gt;</code>{=html} <code>&lt;digits&gt;</code>{=html}</p> <p><code>&lt;alphanumeric identifier&gt;</code>{=html} ::= <code>&lt;non-digit&gt;</code>{=html} <code>&lt;non-digit&gt;</code>{=html} <code>&lt;identifier characters&gt;</code>{=html} <code>&lt;identifier characters&gt;</code>{=html} <code>&lt;non-digit&gt;</code>{=html} <code>&lt;identifier characters&gt;</code>{=html} <code>&lt;non-digit&gt;</code>{=html} <code>&lt;identifier characters&gt;</code>{=html}</p> <p><code>&lt;numeric identifier&gt;</code>{=html} ::= \"0\" <code>&lt;positive digit&gt;</code>{=html} <code>&lt;positive digit&gt;</code>{=html} <code>&lt;digits&gt;</code>{=html}</p> <p><code>&lt;identifier characters&gt;</code>{=html} ::= <code>&lt;identifier character&gt;</code>{=html} <code>&lt;identifier character&gt;</code>{=html} <code>&lt;identifier characters&gt;</code>{=html}</p> <p><code>&lt;identifier character&gt;</code>{=html} ::= <code>&lt;digit&gt;</code>{=html} <code>&lt;non-digit&gt;</code>{=html}</p> <p><code>&lt;non-digit&gt;</code>{=html} ::= <code>&lt;letter&gt;</code>{=html} \"-\"</p> <p><code>&lt;digits&gt;</code>{=html} ::= <code>&lt;digit&gt;</code>{=html} <code>&lt;digit&gt;</code>{=html} <code>&lt;digits&gt;</code>{=html}</p> <p><code>&lt;digit&gt;</code>{=html} ::= \"0\" <code>&lt;positive digit&gt;</code>{=html}</p> <p><code>&lt;positive digit&gt;</code>{=html} ::= \"1\" \"2\" \"3\" \"4\" \"5\" \"6\" \"7\" \"8\" \"9\"</p> <p><code>&lt;letter&gt;</code>{=html} ::= \"A\" \"B\" \"C\" \"D\" \"E\" \"F\" \"G\" \"H\" \"I\" \"J\" \"K\" \"L\" \"M\" \"N\" \"O\" \"P\" \"Q\" \"R\" \"S\" \"T\" \"U\" \"V\" \"W\" \"X\" \"Y\" \"Z\" \"a\" \"b\" \"c\" \"d\" \"e\" \"f\" \"g\" \"h\" \"i\" \"j\" \"k\" \"l\" \"m\" \"n\" \"o\" \"p\" \"q\" \"r\" \"s\" \"t\" \"u\" \"v\" \"w\" \"x\" \"y\" \"z\"</p>"},{"location":"s/Sequence%20Model/","title":"Sequence Model","text":"<p>Specifies the set of object roles and their interactions by showing and describing the messages exchanged.

Most landline calls are routed by purpose-built electronic hardware; however, soft switches using general purpose servers and VoIP technology are becoming more popular.[1]</p> <p>Many telecommunications networks now make use of combinations of softswitches and more traditional purpose-built hardware.</p> <p>Although the term softswitch technically refers to any such device, it is more conventionally applied to a device that handles IP-to-IP phone calls, while the phrase \"access server\" or \"media gateway\" is used to refer to devices that either originate or terminate traditional \"land line\" (hard wired) phone calls. In practice, such devices can often do both. As a practical distinction, a Skype-to-Skype phone call is entirely IP (internet) based, and so uses a softswitch somewhere in the middle connecting the calling party with the called party. In contrast, access servers might take a mobile call or a call originating from a traditional phone line, convert it to IP traffic, then send it over the internet to another such device, which terminates the call by reversing the process and converting the Voice over IP call back to older circuit switched digital systems using traditional digital ISDN / PSTN protocols that transmit voice traffic using non-IP systems.</p> <p>The Call Agent takes care of functions such as billing, call routing, signaling, call services and the like, supplying the functional logic to accomplish these telephony meta-tasks. A call agent may control several different media gateways in geographically dispersed areas via a TCP/IP link. It is also used to control the functions of media gateway, in order to connect with media as well as other interfaces. This procedure is utilized to keep the interfaces clear as crystal for receiving calls from any phone lines.[2]</p> <p>The softswitch generally resides in a building owned by the telephone company called a telephone exchange (UK/IRL/AUS/NZ) or central office (US/CAN). The central office or telephone exchange has high capacity connections to carry calls to other offices owned by the telecommunication company and to other telecommunication companies via the PSTN.</p> <p>Looking towards the end users from the switch, the softswitch may be connected to several access devices via TCP/IP network. These access devices can range from small and large Analog Telephone Adaptors (ATA) which provide from one to hundreds of Telephone Pairs to an Integrated Access Device (IAD), eMTA s (embedded Multimedia Terminal Adapters) using MGCP/NCS protocol over cable (VoCable) or PBX which may provide several hundred telephone connections</p> <p>Note here that Analogue (ATA), PSTN telephone devices can only be reached by a softswitch that has embedded SS7 or SIGTRAN cards, software in terms of signalling AND Trunking Gateway for Voice traffic IP/TDM, TDM/IP, TDM/TDM functions.</p> <p>Typically the larger access devices will be located in a building owned by the telecommunication company near to the customers they serve. Each end user can be connected to the IAD by a simple pair of copper wires.</p> <p>The medium-sized devices and PBXs are most commonly used by business that locate them on their own premises, and single-line devices are mostly found at private residences.</p> <p>At the turn of the 21st century with IP Multimedia Subsystem (or IMS), the Softswitch element is represented by the Media Gateway Controller (MGC) element, and the term \"Softswitch\" is rarely used in the IMS context.

Many of these switches reside all over the United Kingdom. Concentrators are usually kept in local telephone exchanges but can be housed remotely in less populated areas. DLEs and DMSUs operate in major towns and cities and provide call routing functions.</p> <p>Concentrator unit\\ The concentrator unit consists of four main sub-systems, line modules, digital concentrator switch, digital line termination (DLT) units and control unit. Its purpose is to convert speech from analogue signals to digital format and concentrate the traffic for onward transmission to the digital local exchange (DLE). It also receives dialled information from the subscriber and passes this to the DLE, so that the call can be routed to its destination. In normal circumstances, it does not switch signals between subscriber lines but has limited capacity to do this if the connection to the DLE is lost.</p> <p>Digital local exchange\\ The Digital Local Exchange (DLE) connects to the concentrator and routes calls to different DLEs or DMSUs depending on the destination of the call. The heart of the DLE is the Digital Subscriber Switching Subsystem (DSSS) which consists of Time Switches and a Space Switch. Incoming traffic on the 30 channel PCM highways from the Concentrator Units is connected to Time Switches. The purpose of these is to take any incoming individual Time Slot and connect it to an outgoing Time Slot and so perform a switching and routing function.</p> <p>Digital main switching unit\\ The Digital Main Switching Unit (DMSU) deals with calls that have been routed by DLEs or another DMSU and is a 'trunk switch', i.e.\u00a0it is not connected to any concentrators.

The     server and client negotiate the details of which encryption     algorithm and cryptographic keys to use before the first byte of     data is transmitted . The negotiation of a shared secret is both     secure (the negotiated secret is unavailable to eavesdroppers and     cannot be obtained, even by an attacker who places themselves in the     middle of the connection) and reliable (no attacker can modify the     communications during the negotiation without being detected).</p> </li> <li> <p>The identity of the communicating parties can be authenticated using     public-key cryptography.

The character repertoire of the Unicode Standard is synchronized with ISO/IEC 10646, and both are code-for-code identical.</p> <p>The Unicode Standard consists of a set of code charts for visual reference, an encoding method and set of standard character encodings, a set of reference data files, and a number of related items, such as character properties, rules for normalization, decomposition, collation, rendering, and bidirectional display order (for the correct display of text containing both right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic and Hebrew, and left-to-right scripts).</p> <p>Unicode's success at unifying character sets has led to its widespread and predominant use in the internationalization and localization of computer software. The standard has been implemented in many recent technologies, including modern operating systems, XML, Java (and other programming languages), and the .NET Framework.</p> <p>Unicode can be implemented by different character encodings.

With 1,114,112 code points on 17 planes being possible, and with over 137,000 code points defined so far, many Unicode characters are beyond the reach of UCS-2. Therefore, UCS-2 is obsolete, though still widely used in software. UTF-16 extends UCS-2, by using the same 16-bit encoding as UCS-2 for the Basic Multilingual Plane, and a 4-byte encoding for the other planes. As long as it contains no code points in the reserved range U+D800--U+DFFF, a UCS-2 text is a valid UTF-16 text.</p> <p>UTF-32 (also referred to as UCS-4) uses four bytes for each character. Like UCS-2, the number of bytes per character is fixed, facilitating character indexing; but unlike UCS-2, UTF-32 is able to encode all Unicode code points.

Since 1987, VHDL has been standardized by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) as IEEE Std 1076; the latest version (as of April 2020) of which is IEEE Std 1076-2019. To model analog and mixed-signal systems, an IEEE-standardized HDL based on VHDL called VHDL-AMS (officially IEEE 1076.1) has been developed.</p> <p>VHDL is named after the United States Department of Defense program that created it, the Very High-Speed Integrated Circuits Program (VHSIC). In the early 1980s, the VHSIC Program sought a new HDL for use in the design of the integrated circuits it aimed to develop. The product of this effort was VHDL Version 7.2, released in 1985. The effort to standardize it as an IEEE standard began in the following year.</p> <p>VHDL is generally used to write text models that describe a logic circuit. Such a model is processed by a synthesis program, only if it is part of the logic design. A simulation program is used to test the logic design using simulation models to represent the logic circuits that interface to the design. This collection of simulation models is commonly called a testbench.</p> <p>A VHDL simulator is typically an event-driven simulator. This means that each transaction is added to an event queue for a specific scheduled time. E.g. if a signal assignment should occur after 1 nanosecond, the event is added to the queue for time +1ns. Zero delay is also allowed, but still needs to be scheduled: for these cases delta delay is used, which represent an infinitely small time step. The simulation alters between two modes: statement execution, where triggered statements are evaluated, and event processing, where events in the queue are processed.</p> <p>VHDL has constructs to handle the parallelism inherent in hardware designs, but these constructs (processes) differ in syntax from the parallel constructs in Ada (tasks). Like Ada, VHDL is strongly typed and is not case sensitive. In order to directly represent operations which are common in hardware, there are many features of VHDL which are not found in Ada, such as an extended set of Boolean operators including nand and nor.</p> <p>VHDL has file input and output capabilities, and can be used as a general-purpose language for text processing, but files are more commonly used by a simulation testbench for stimulus or verification data. There are some VHDL compilers which build executable binaries. In this case, it might be possible to use VHDL to write a testbench to verify the functionality of the design using files on the host computer to define stimuli, to interact with the user, and to compare results with those expected. However, most designers leave this job to the simulator.</p> <p>It is relatively easy for an inexperienced developer to produce code that simulates successfully but that cannot be synthesized into a real device, or is too large to be practical. One particular pitfall is the accidental production of transparent latches rather than D-type flip-flops as storage elements.</p> <p>One can design hardware in a VHDL IDE (for FPGA implementation such as Xilinx ISE, Altera Quartus, Synopsys Synplify or Mentor Graphics HDL Designer) to produce the RTL schematic of the desired circuit. After that, the generated schematic can be verified using simulation software which shows the waveforms of inputs and outputs of the circuit after generating the appropriate testbench. To generate an appropriate testbench for a particular circuit or VHDL code, the inputs have to be defined correctly. For example, for clock input, a loop process or an iterative statement is required.</p> <p>A final point is that when a VHDL model is translated into the \"gates and wires\" that are mapped onto a programmable logic device such as a CPLD or FPGA, then it is the actual hardware being configured, rather than the VHDL code being \"executed\" as if on some form of a processor chip.</p> <p>-- (this is a VHDL comment) /this is a block comment (VHDL-2008)/ -- import std_logic from the IEEE library library IEEE; use IEEE.std_logic_1164.all;</p> <p>-- this is the entity entity ANDGATE is port ( I1 : in std_logic; I2 : in std_logic; O : out std_logic); end entity ANDGATE;</p> <p>-- this is the architecture architecture RTL of ANDGATE is begin O \\&lt;= I1 and I2;</p> <p>library IEEE; use IEEE.std_logic_1164.all; use IEEE.numeric_std.all; -- for the unsigned type</p> <p>entity COUNTER is generic ( WIDTH : in natural := 32); port ( RST : in std_logic; CLK : in std_logic; LOAD : in std_logic; DATA : in std_logic_vector(WIDTH-1 downto 0); Q : out std_logic_vector(WIDTH-1 downto 0)); end entity COUNTER;</p> <p>architecture RTL of COUNTER is</p> <p>begin process(all) is begin if RST then Q \\&lt;= (others =&gt; '0'); elsif rising_edge(CLK) then if LOAD then Q \\&lt;= DATA; else Q \\&lt;= std_logic_vector(unsigned(Q) + 1); --Addition is unsigned, converted back to std_logic_vector end if; end if; end process;</p> <p>end architecture RTL;</p>"},{"location":"v/VISP/","title":"VISP","text":"<p>Virtual ISP</p> <p>A Virtual ISP (VISP), also known as an Affinity ISP, is an Internet Service Provider (ISP) that resells the resources of existing ISPs under another brand name.</p>"},{"location":"v/VLAN/","title":"VLAN","text":"<p>Virtual LAN</p> <p>A virtual LAN (VLAN) is any broadcast domain that is partitioned and isolated in a computer network at the data link layer (OSI layer 2).[1][2] LAN is the abbreviation for local area network and in this context virtual refers to a physical object recreated and altered by additional logic.

In 2011, RFC 3920 and RFC 3921 were superseded by RFC 6120 and RFC 6121 respectively, with RFC 6122 specifying the XMPP address format. In 2015, RFC 6122 was superseded by RFC 7622. In addition to these core protocols standardized at the IETF, the XMPP Standards Foundation (formerly the Jabber Software Foundation) is active in developing open XMPP extensions.</p>"},{"location":"x/XP/","title":"XP","text":"<p>eXtreme Programming</p> <p>Programming Extreme Programming (XP) is an agile software development framework that aims to produce higher quality software, and higher quality of life for the development team.

Cross-site scripting carried out on websites accounted for roughly 84% of all security vulnerabilities documented by Symantec as of 2007. Bug bounty company HackerOne in 2017 reported that XSS is still a major threat vector.

It is commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted. YAML targets many of the same communications applications as Extensible Markup Language (XML) but has a minimal syntax which intentionally differs from SGML. It uses both Python-style indentation to indicate nesting, and a more compact format that uses [...] for lists and {...} for maps thus JSON files are valid YAML 1.2.</p> <p>Custom data types are allowed, but YAML natively encodes scalars (such as strings, integers, and floats), lists, and associative arrays (also known as maps, dictionaries or hashes). These data types are based on the Perl programming language, though all commonly used high-level programming languages share very similar concepts. The colon-centered syntax, used for expressing key-value pairs, is inspired by electronic mail headers as defined in RFC 822, and the document separator --- is borrowed from MIME (RFC 2046). Escape sequences are reused from C, and whitespace wrapping for multi-line strings is inspired by HTML. Lists and hashes can contain nested lists and hashes, forming a tree structure; arbitrary graphs can be represented using YAML aliases (similar to XML in SOAP).

Zigbee devices can transmit data over long distances by passing data through a mesh network of intermediate devices to reach more distant ones.
