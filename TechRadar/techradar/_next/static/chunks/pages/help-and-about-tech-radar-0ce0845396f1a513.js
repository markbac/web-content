This radar provides a comprehensive view of the technologies, tools, methods, and platforms I currently use or explore within the fields of architecture and embedded software. It serves as a guide to:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Track current expertise</strong>: Highlight technologies and tools I have adopted or mastered.</li>\\n<li><strong>Explore new areas</strong>: Identify technologies I am trialing or assessing for future adoption.</li>\\n<li><strong>Organize knowledge</strong>: Categorize technologies into clear quadrants and rings for better clarity.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>Quadrants</h4>\\n<p>The radar is divided into four quadrants, each representing a specific domain:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><strong>Languages &amp; Frameworks</strong>: Programming languages and associated frameworks used in software development.</li>\\n<li><strong>Platforms &amp; Operations</strong>: Platforms, environments, and operational tools for deployment and management.</li>\\n<li><strong>Methods &amp; Patterns</strong>: Software engineering methods, design principles, and architectural patterns.</li>\\n<li><strong>Tools</strong>: Development tools, IDEs, and utilities that support software engineering tasks.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h4>Rings</h4>\\n<p>Each technology is assigned a ring based on its level of maturity and usage:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Adopt</strong>: Proven and valuable technologies that I actively use.</li>\\n<li><strong>Trial</strong>: Promising technologies undergoing evaluation in projects.</li>\\n<li><strong>Assess</strong>: Emerging technologies under consideration for future exploration.</li>\\n<li><strong>Hold</strong>: Technologies that are currently deprioritized or obsolete.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Customizing the Radar</h3>\\n<p>This radar is created and maintained by me, and its content reflects my personal journey in technology and software development. It is updated periodically to include new findings, discard outdated tools, and refine my focus areas. Feel free to adapt this structure if you are building your own personal radar.</p>\\n<h3>Contributing to the Personal Technology Radar</h3>\\n<p>While this radar is personal, I welcome discussions or feedback from peers interested in similar areas.
